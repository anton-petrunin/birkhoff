Let $\Omega$ be the circle with center $O$ and radius $r$.
The \index{inversion}\emph{inversion} of a point $P$ with respect to $\Omega$ is the point $P'\in[OP)$ such that
$$OP\cdot OP'=r^2.$$
In this case the circle  will be called the 
\index{inversion!circle of inversion}\emph{circle of inversion} 
and its center is called \index{inversion!center of inversion}\emph{center of inversion}.

The inversion of $O$ is undefined.

Note that 
if $P$ is inside $\Omega$ then $P'$ is outside
 and the other way around. 
Further, $P=P'$ if and only if $P\in \Omega$.

Note that the inversion takes $P'$  back to $P$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:constr-inversion}
Let $P$ be a point inside of a circle $\Omega$ centered at $O$.
Let $T$ be a point where the perpendicular to $(OP)$ from $P$ intersects $\Omega$.
Let $P'$ be the point where the tangent to $\Omega$ at $T$ intersects $(OP)$.

Show that $P'$ is the inversion of $P$ in the circle $\Omega$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:inversion-sim}
Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with center $O$ in the Euclidean plane.
Assume $A'$ and $B'$ are inversions of $A$ and $B$ in $\Gamma$.
Then 
$$\triangle O A B\sim\triangle O B' A'.$$
Moreover,
$$\begin{aligned}
\measuredangle AOB&\equiv -\measuredangle B'OA',
\\
\measuredangle OBA&\equiv -\measuredangle OA'B',
\\
\measuredangle BAO&\equiv -\measuredangle A'B'O.

\parit{Proof.}
Let $r$ be the radius of the circle of the inversion.

From the definition of inversion, we get
\begin{align*}
OA\cdot OA'=OB\cdot OB'=r^2.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$\frac{OA}{OB'}=\frac{OB}{OA'}.$$

Clearly 
$$\measuredangle AOB= \measuredangle A'OB'\equiv -\measuredangle B'OA'.\eqlbl{eq:-AOB}$$
From SAS, we get 
$$\triangle O A B\z\sim\triangle O B' A'.$$

Applying Theorem~\ref{thm:signs-of-triug} and \ref{eq:-AOB},
we get \ref{eq:-angle}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}%
\label{ex:appolo-circ}
Let $P'$ be the inversion of $P$ in the circle $\Gamma$.
Assume that $P\ne P'$.
Show that the value $\frac{PX}{P'X}$ is the same for all $X\in\Gamma$.
\end{thm}

The converse to the above exercise also holds.
Namely, given positive real number $k\ne 1$ 
and two distinct points $P$ and $P'$ in the Euclidean plane
the locus of points $X$ such that $\frac{PX}{P'X}=k$ forms a circle which is called \index{circle of Apollonius}\emph{circle of Apollonius}.
In this case $P'$ is inverse of $P$ in the circle of Apollonius.

\section*{Cross-ratio}\index{cross-ratio}
\addtocontents{toc}{Cross-ratio.}

The following theorem gives 
some quantities expressed in distances or angles which do not change after inversion.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{lem:inverse-4-angle}
Let $ABCD$ and $A'B'C'D'$  be two quadrilaterals  in the Euclidean plane
such that the points $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ and $D'$ are inversions of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ correspondingly.

Then 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{lem:inverse-4-angle:cross-ratio} $$\frac{AB\cdot CD}{BC\cdot DA}= \frac{A'B'\cdot C'D'}{B'C'\cdot D'A'}.$$
\item\label{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle} 
$$\measuredangle ABC+\measuredangle CDA\equiv -(\measuredangle A'B'C'+\measuredangle C'D'A').$$
\item\label{lem:inverse-4-angle:inscribed}
If quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed then so is $A'B'C'D'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof; (\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:cross-ratio}).}
Let $O$ be the center of inversion.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:inversion-sim},
$\triangle AOB\z\sim \triangle B'OA'$.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
&&\frac{AB}{A'B'} &=\frac{OA}{OB'}.
\intertext{Analogously,}
\frac{BC}{B'C'}&=\frac{OC}{OB'},&
\frac{CD}{C'D'}&=\frac{OC}{OD'},&
\frac{DA}{D'A'}&=\frac{OA}{OD'}.
\end{align*}

Therefore 
\begin{align*}
 \frac{AB}{A'B'}\cdot \frac{B'C'}{BC}\cdot \frac{CD}{C'D'}\cdot \frac{D'A'}{DA}
&= \frac{OA}{OB'}
\cdot\frac{OB'}{OC}
\cdot\frac{OC}{OD'}
\cdot\frac{OD'}{OA}=1.
\end{align*}
Hence (\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:cross-ratio}) follows.

\parit{(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}).}
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:inversion-sim},
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle ABO&\equiv -\measuredangle B'A'O,
&
\measuredangle OBC&\equiv -\measuredangle OA'B',\\
\measuredangle CDO&\equiv -\measuredangle D'C'O,
&
\measuredangle ODA&\equiv -\measuredangle OA'D'.
\end{align*}
Summing these four identities we get
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle ABC+\measuredangle CDA
&\equiv -(\measuredangle D'C'B'+\measuredangle B'A'D').
\intertext{Applying Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2b} and Exercise~\ref{ex:quadrilateral}, we get}
\measuredangle A'B'C'+\measuredangle C'D'A'
&\equiv -(\measuredangle B'C'D'+\measuredangle D'A'B')\equiv
\\
&\equiv \measuredangle D'C'B'+\measuredangle B'A'D'.
\end{align*}
Hence (\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}) follows.

\parit{(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:inscribed}).}
Follows from (\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}) and Theorem \ref{thm:inscribed-quadrilateral}.

\section*{Inversive plane and circlines}
\addtocontents{toc}{Inversive plane and circlines.}

Let $\Omega$ be a circle with center $O$ and radius $r$.
Consider the inversion in $\Omega$.

Recall that inversion of $O$ is undefined.
To deal with this problem it is useful to add to the plane an extra point;
it will be called \index{pint at infinity}\emph{the point at infinity}
and we will denote it as \index{$\infty$}$\infty$.
We can assume that $\infty$ is inversion of $O$ and the other way around.

The Euclidean plane with added a point at infinity is called \index{plane!inversive plane}\index{inversive plane}\emph{inversive plane}.

We will always assume that any line and half-line contains $\infty$. 

It will be convenient to use notion of 
\index{circline}\emph{circline},
which means {}\emph{circle or line};
for instance we may say 
{}\emph{if circline contains $\infty$ then it is a line} or {}\emph{circline which does not contain $\infty$  is a circle}.

Note that according to Theorem~\ref{thm:circumcenter}, 
for any $\triangle ABC$ there is unique circline which pass through $A$, $B$ and $C$.



\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:inverse-cline}
In the inversive plane, inversion of a circline is a circline.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $O$ the center of inverse.

Let $\Gamma$ be a circline.
Choose three distinct points $A$, $B$ and $C$ on $\Gamma$.
(If $\triangle ABC$ is nondegenerate then $\Gamma$ is the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$;
if $\triangle ABC$ is degenerate then $\Gamma$ is the line passing through $A$, $B$ and $C$.)

Denote by $A'$, $B'$ and $C'$ the inversions of $A$, $B$ and $C$ correspondingly.
Let $\Gamma'$ be the circline which pass though $A'$, $B'$ and $C'$.
According to \ref{thm:circumcenter}, $\Gamma'$ is well defined.

Assume $D$ is a point of inversive plane which is distinct from $A$, $C$, $O$ and $\infty$.
Denote by $D'$ the inversion of $D$.

By Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:inscribed}),
$D'\in\Gamma'$ if and only if $D\in\Gamma$.
Hence the result follows.

It remains to prove that 
$O\in \Gamma$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $\infty\in\Gamma'$ 
and 
$\infty\in \Gamma$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $O\in\Gamma'$.
Since $\Gamma$ is inversion of $\Gamma'$ it is sufficient to prove only 
$$\infty\in \Gamma\ \ \iff\ \ O\in\Gamma'.$$

Since $\infty\in\Gamma$ we get that $\Gamma$ is a line.
Therefore for any $\epsilon>0$, the line $\Gamma$ contains point $P$ with  $OP>r^2/\epsilon$.
For the inversion $P'\in\Gamma'$ of $P$, we have $OP'=r^2/OP<\epsilon$.
That is, the circline $\Gamma'$ contains points arbitrary close to $O$.
It follows that $O\in \Gamma'$.

it is impossible to construct the center of given circle.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:tangent-circ->parallels}
Show that for any pair of tangent circles in the inversive plane there is an inversion which sends them to a pair of parallel lines.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:inverse}
Consider inversion with respect to circle $\Omega$ with center $O$ in the inversive plane. 
Then 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{thm:inverse:line-line}
Line passing through $O$ is inverted into itself.
\item\label{thm:inverse:line} 
Line not passing through $O$ is inverted into a circle which pass through $O$, and the other way around.
\item\label{thm:inverse:circle} 
A circle not passing through $O$ is inverted into a circle not passing through $O$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
In the proof we use Theorem~\ref{thm:inverse-cline} without mentioning.

\parit{(\ref{thm:inverse:line-line}).}
Note that if line passing through $O$ it contains both $\infty$ and $O$.
Therefore its inversion also contains $\infty$ and $O$.
In particular image is a line passing through $O$.

\parit{(\ref{thm:inverse:line}).}
Since any line $\ell$ pass through $\infty$, its image $\ell'$ has to contain $O$.
If the line did not contain $O$ then $\ell'\not\ni \infty$;
that is $\ell'$ is not a line.
Therefore $\ell'$ is a circle which pass through $O$. 

\parit{(\ref{thm:inverse:circle}).}
If circle $\Gamma$ does not contain $O$ 
then its image $\Gamma'$ does not contain $\infty$.
Therefore $\Gamma'$ is a circle.
Since  $\Gamma\not\ni\infty$ we get $\Gamma' \not\ni O$.
Hence the result follows.

\section*{Ptolemy's identity}
\addtocontents{toc}{Ptolemy's identity.}

Here is one application of inversion,
which we include as an illustration only;
we will not use it further in the book.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $ABCD$ be an inscribed quadrilateral in the Euclidean plane.
Assume that the points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ appear on the circline in the same order.
Then 
$$ AB\cdot CD+ BC\cdot DA=AC\cdot BD.$$

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the points $A,B,C,D$ lie on one line in this order.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{38mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(-0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/ptolemy-line(1)}

\lbl[wt]{8,4;$x$}
\lbl[wt]{18,4;$y$}
\lbl[wt]{29,4;$z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Set $x\z=AB$, $y=BC$, $z\z=CD$.
Note that
$$x\cdot z+y\cdot (x+y+z)=(x+y)\cdot(y+z).$$
Since $AC\z=x+y$, $BD=y+z$ and $DA\z=x+y+z$,
it proves the identity.


\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{36mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/ABCD-circ(1)}

%\lbl[tw]{8,32;$x$}
%\lbl[tw]{18,32;$y$}
%\lbl[tw]{27,32;$z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

It remains to consider the case when quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle, say $\Gamma$. 


The identity can be rewritten as 
$$\frac{AB\cdot DC}{ BD\cdot CA}+ \frac{BC\cdot AD}{CA\cdot DB}=1.$$
On the left hand side we have two cross-ratios.
According to Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:cross-ratio}), the left hand side does not change if we apply an inversion to each point.

Consider an inversion in a circle centered at a point $O$ which lie on $\Gamma$ between $A$ and $D$.
By 
Theorem~\ref{thm:inverse},
this inversion maps $\Gamma$ to a line.
This reduces the problem to the case when $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ lie on one line, which was already considered.

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

In the proof above we noted that we rewrite Ptolemy identity in a form which is invariant with respect to inversion 
and then apply an inversion which makes it evident.
The solution of the following exercise is based on the same idea;
one has to apply an inversion with center at $A$.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:inverse}
Assume that three circles tangent to each other and to two parallel lines as shown on the picture.
Show that the line passing through the point of tangency $A$ and $B$ on the diagram is also tangent to the two circles at $A$.
\end{thm}


\section*{Perpendicular circles}
\addtocontents{toc}{Perpendicular circles.}

Assume two circles $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ intersect at two points say $X$ and $Y$.
Let $\ell$ and $m$ be the tangent lines at $X$ to $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ correspondingly.
Analogously, $\ell'$ and $m'$ be the tangent lines at $Y$ to $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$.

From Exercise~\ref{ex:two-arcs}, we get that  
 $\ell\perp m$ if and only if $\ell'\perp m'$.

We say that circle $\Gamma$ is \index{perpendicular circles}\emph{perpendicular} to circle $\Omega$ 
(briefly $\Gamma\perp \Omega$)
if they intersect and the lines tangent to the circle at one point 
(and therefore both points) 
of intersection are perpendicular.

Similarly, we say that circle $\Gamma$ is perpendicular to a line $\ell$ (briefly $\Gamma\perp \ell$)
if $\Gamma\cap\ell\ne \emptyset$ and $\ell$ perpendicular to the tangent lines to $\Gamma$ at one point (and therefore both points) of intersection.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent}, 
it happens only if the line $\ell$ pass through the center of $\Gamma$.

Now we can talk about \index{perpendicular circlines}\emph{perpendicular circlines}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:perp-inverse}
Assume $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ are distinct circles in the Euclidean plane. 
Then $\Omega\perp\Gamma$ if and only if the circle $\Gamma$ coincides with its inversion in $\Omega$.
\end{thm}

\lbl[lb]{20.5,18;$Q$}
\lbl[tr]{9.5,9;$O$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.} 
Denote by $\Gamma'$ the inversion of $\Gamma$.

\parit{}($\Rightarrow$)
Let $O$ be the center of $\Omega$
and $Q$ be the center of $\Gamma$.
Denote by $X$ and $Y$ the points of intersections of  $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent}, $\Gamma\perp\Omega$ if and only if $(OX)$ and $(OY)$ are tangent to $\Gamma$.

Note that $\Gamma'$ is also tangent to $(OX)$ and $(OY)$ at $X$ and $Y$ correspondingly. 
It follows that $X$ and $Y$ are the foot points of the center of $\Gamma'$ on $(OX)$ and $(OY)$.
Therefore both $\Gamma'$ and $\Gamma$ have the center $Q$.
Finally, $\Gamma'=\Gamma$, since both circles pass through $X$.

\parit{}($\Leftarrow$)
Assume $\Gamma=\Gamma'$.

Since $\Gamma\ne \Omega$, there is a point $P$ which lies on $\Gamma$, but not on $\Omega$.
Let $P'$ be the inversion of $P$ in $\Omega$.
Since $\Gamma=\Gamma'$, we have $P'\in \Gamma$,
in particular the half-line $[OP)$ intersects $\Gamma$ at two points.
By Exercise \ref{ex:inside-outside}, 
 $O$ lies outside of $\Gamma$.

As $\Gamma$ has points inside and outside $\Omega$,
the circles $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ intersect.
The later follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:tangent-circles-2}(\ref{ex:tangent-circles-2:b}).

Let $X$ be a point of their intersection.
We need to show $(OX)$ is tangent to $\Gamma$;
that is $X$ is the only intersection point of $(OX)$ and $\Gamma$.

Assume $Z$ is an other point of intersection.
Since $O$ is outside of $\Gamma$, 
the point $Z$ lies on the half-line $[OX)$.

Denote by $Z'$ the inversion of $Z$ in $\Omega$.
Clearly the three points $Z, Z', X$ lie on $\Gamma$ and $(OX)$.
The later  contradicts Lemma~\ref{lem:line-circle}.
\qeds 

It is convenient to define \index{inversion in the line}\emph{inversion in the line} as the reflection through this line.
This way we can talk about \index{inversion in  circline}\emph{inversion in arbitrary circline}.


\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:perp-inverse-clines}
Let $\Omega$  and $\Gamma$ be distinct circlines in the inversive plane.
Then
the inversion in $\Omega$ sends $\Gamma$ to itself if and only if $\Omega\perp\Gamma$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By Theorem \ref{thm:perp-inverse}, it is sufficient to consider the case when $\Omega$ or $\Gamma$ is a line.

Assume $\Omega$ is a line, so the inversion in $\Omega$ is reflection.
In this case the statement follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:reflection+angle}.

If $\Gamma$ is a line then the statement follows from 
Theorem~\ref{thm:inverse}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:perp-inverse}
Let $P$ and $P'$ be two distinct points  in the Euclidean plane
such that $P'$ is the inversion of $P$ in the circle $\Omega$.
Assume that a circline $\Gamma$ pass through $P$ and $P'$.
Then $\Gamma\perp\Omega$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Without loss of generality we may assume that $P$ is inside and $P'$ is outside $\Omega$.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:abc}, $\Gamma$ intersects $\Omega$.
Denote by $A$ a point of intersection.


Denote by $\Gamma'$ the inversion of $\Gamma$.
Since $A$ is inversion of itself, the points $A$, $P$ and $P'$ lie on  $\Gamma'$.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:unique-cline},
$\Gamma'=\Gamma$
and
by Theorem \ref{thm:perp-inverse}, $\Gamma\perp\Omega$.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:h-line} Let $P$ and $Q$ be two distinct points inside the circle $\Omega$ in the Euclidean plane.
Then there is unique circline $\Gamma$ perpendicular to $\Omega$ which pass through $P$ and $Q$.  
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $P'$ be the inversion of point $P$ in a circle $\Omega$.
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse},
the circline passing through $P$ and $Q$  is perpendicular to $\Omega$ if and only if it pass though $P'$.

Note that $P'$ lies outside of $\Omega$.
Therefore the points $P$, $P'$ and $Q$ are distinct.

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:unique-cline},
there is unique circline passing through $P$, $Q$ and $P'$.
Hence the result follows.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:construction-perp-clines}

\section*{Angles after inversion}
\addtocontents{toc}{Angles after inversion.}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
In the inversive plane,
the inversion of an arc is an arc.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Consider four distinct points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$; 
let $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ and $D'$  be their inverses.
We need to show that $D$ lies on the arc $ABC$ if and only if $D'$ lies on the arc $A'B'C'$.
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:arc(angle=angle)},
the later is equivalent to the following
$$\measuredangle ADC= \measuredangle ABC
\ \  \iff\ \ 
\measuredangle A'D'C'= \measuredangle A'B'C'$$
and it follows from Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}).
\qeds

The following theorem roughly says that the angle between arcs changes sign after the inversion.

\begin{align*}
\measuredangle X_1AX_2&\equiv\measuredangle X_1AC_1+\measuredangle C_1AC_2+\measuredangle C_2AX_2\equiv
\\
&\equiv(\pi-\measuredangle C_1B_1A)+\measuredangle C_1AC_2+(\pi-\measuredangle AB_2 C_2)\equiv
\\
&
\equiv -(\measuredangle C_1B_1A+\measuredangle AB_2 C_2 +\measuredangle C_2 A C_1)\equiv
\\
&\equiv 
-(\measuredangle C_1B_1A+\measuredangle AB_2 C_1)
-(\measuredangle C_1B_2C_2 +\measuredangle C_2 A C_1).
\intertext{The same way we get}
\measuredangle Y_1A'Y_2&\equiv-(\measuredangle C_1'B_1'A'+\measuredangle A'B_2' C_1')
-(\measuredangle C_1'B_2'C_2' +\measuredangle C_2' A' C_1').
\end{align*}

By Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}),
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle C_1B_1A+\measuredangle AB_2 C_1&\equiv-(\measuredangle C_1'B_1'A'+\measuredangle A'B_2' C_1'),
\\
\measuredangle C_1B_2C_2 +\measuredangle C_2 A C_1&\equiv-(\measuredangle C_1'B_2'C_2' +\measuredangle C_2' A' C_1').
\end{align*}
Hence the result follows.\qeds




\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:invese-comp}
Let $P'$, $Q'$ and $\Gamma'$ 
be the inversions of the points $P$, $Q$ and the circle $\Gamma$ in the circle $\Omega$ of the Euclidean plane.
Assume $P$ is inversion of $Q$ in $\Gamma$ then 
$P'$ is inversion of $Q'$ in $\Gamma'$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
If $P=Q$ then $P'=Q'\in\Gamma'$ therefore $P'$ is inversion of $Q'$ in $\Gamma'$.

It remains to consider the case $P\ne Q$. 
Let $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ be two distinct circles which intersect at $P$ and $Q$.
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse}, 
$\Delta_1\perp\Gamma$ and $\Delta_2\perp\Gamma$.

Denote by $\Delta_1'$ and $\Delta_2'$ the inversions of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ in $\Omega$.
Clearly $\Delta_1'$ and $\Delta_2'$ intersect at $P'$ and $Q'$.

From Theorem~\ref{thm:angle-inversion}, the later is equivalent 
to $\Delta_1'\perp\Gamma'$ and $\Delta_2'\z\perp\Gamma'$.
By Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse-clines} the later implies $P'$ is inversion of $Q'$ in $\Gamma'$.
