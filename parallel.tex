In consequence of Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:1}, 
any two distinct lines $\ell$ and $m$ have either one point
in common or none. 
In the first case they are \index{intersecting lines}\emph{intersecting} (briefly \index{36@\hskip.4mm$\nparallel$\hskip.4mm}$\ell\nparallel m$); 
in the second case, $\ell$ and $m$ are said to be \index{parallel lines}\emph{parallel} (briefly \index{36@\hskip.4mm$\parallel$\hskip.4mm}$\ell\parallel m$);
in addition, a line is always regarded as parallel to itself.

}

To emphasize that two lines on a diagram are parallel we will mark them with arrows of the same type.



\begin{thm}[\abs]{Proposition}\label{prop:perp-perp} Let $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ be three lines.
Assume that $n\perp m$ and $m\perp \ell$.
Then $\ell\parallel n$. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the contrary; 
that is, $\ell\nparallel n$.
Then there is a point, say $Z$, of intersection of $\ell$ and~$n$.
Then by Theorem~\ref{perp:ex+un},
$\ell=n$.
Since any line is parallel to itself, we have that $\ell\parallel n$ --- a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:parallel}
For any point $P$ and any line $\ell$
there is a unique line $m$
which passes thru $P$ and is parallel to~$\ell$.
\end{thm}

The above theorem has two parts, existence and uniqueness.
In the proof of uniqueness we will use the method of similar triangles.

\parit{Proof; existence.} 
Apply Theorem~\ref{perp:ex+un} two times,
first to construct the line $m$ thru $P$ which is perpendicular to $\ell$,
and second to construct the line $n$ thru $P$ which is perpendicular to~$m$.
Then apply Proposition~\ref{prop:perp-perp}.

\parit{Uniqueness.}
If $P\in\ell$, then $m=\ell$ by the definition of parallel lines.
Further we assume $P\notin\ell$.

Let us construct the lines $n\ni P$ and $m\ni P$ as in the proof of existence, so $m\parallel \ell$.

Assume there is yet another line $s\ni P$ which is distinct from $m$ and parallel to~$\ell$.
Choose a point $Q\in s$ which lies with $\ell$ on the same side from~$m$.
Let $R$ be the foot point of $Q$ on~$n$.

\end{lpic}
\end{figure}

Let $D$ be the point of intersection of $n$ and~$\ell$.
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:perp-perp} $(QR)\parallel m$. 
Therefore, $Q$, $R$, and $\ell$ lie on the same side of~$m$. 
In particular, $R\in [P D)$.

Choose $Z\in [P Q)$ such that 
$$\frac{PZ}{PQ}=\frac{PD}{PR}.$$
By SAS similarity condition (or equivalently by Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4})
we have that $\triangle RPQ\sim \triangle DPZ$;
therefore $(Z D)\perp(P D)$.
It follows that $Z$ lies on $\ell$ and $s$ --- a contradiction.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:parallel-1}
Assume $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ are lines
such that $\ell\parallel m$ and $m\parallel n$.
Then $\ell\parallel n$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the contrary; that is, $\ell\nparallel n$.
Then there is a point $P\in \ell\cap n$.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel},
$n=\ell$ --- a contradiction.
\qeds

Note that from the definition, we have that $\ell\parallel m$ if and only if $m\z\parallel \ell$.
Therefore, according to the above corollary, ``$\parallel$'' is an 
\index{equivalence relation}\emph{equivalence relation}.
That is, for any lines $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\ell\parallel \ell$;
\item if $\ell\parallel m$, then $m\parallel \ell$;
\item if $\ell\parallel m$ and $m\parallel n$, then 
$\ell\parallel n$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:perp-perp}
Let $k$, $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ be lines such that $k\perp \ell$, $\ell\perp m$, and $m\perp n$.
Show that $k\nparallel n$.

\section*{Transversal property}
\addtocontents{toc}{Transversal property.}

If the line $t$ intersects each line $\ell$ and $m$ at one point, then we say that $t$ is a \index{transversal}\emph{transversal} to $\ell$ and~$m$.
For example, on the diagram, line $(CB)$ is a transversal 
to $(AB)$ and~$(CD)$.

}

\begin{thm}{Transversal property}\label{thm:parallel-2} 
$(AB)\parallel(C D)$ if and only if 
$$2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D)\equiv 0.
\eqlbl{A B C + B C D}$$ 
Equivalently 
$$\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D
\equiv 
0
\quad
\text{or}
\quad
\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D
\equiv
\pi.$$ 
Moreover, if $(AB)\ne(C D)$, then in the first case 
$A$ and $D$ lie on the opposite sides of $(BC)$,
in the second case 
$A$ and $D$ lie on the same sides of~$(BC)$.
\end{thm}

The following lemma will be used several times in the sequel.

%(???

\begin{thm}[\abs]{Lemma}\label{lem:2angles1}
Let $ABC$ be a nondegenerate triangle.
Then there is a point $X\notin(AC)$ such that 
\[\measuredangle BAX=\measuredangle ABC\]
and, moreover, $X$ lies with $B$ on the same side of $(AC)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{23mm}
\centering
\begin{lpic}[t(-6mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/2sum1(1)}
\lbl[l]{16,2;$A$}

\lbl[r]{0,2;$C$}
\lbl[b]{20,23;$X$}
\lbl[l]{11.5,12;$M$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.} 
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $[AB]$.
Choose $X\z\in (CM)$ distinct from $C$ so that $XM=CM$.


Note that the angles $CMB$ and $XMA$
are vertical;
in particular, 
$$\measuredangle CMB=\measuredangle XMA.\eqlbl{eq:CMB=XMA}$$
By construction, $AM\z=BM$ and $CM\z=XM$.
Therefore, 
$$\triangle CMB\cong \triangle XMA;$$ 
in particular $\measuredangle ABC\equiv\pm \measuredangle BAX$.
Since angles of $\triangle A M X$ have the same sign (\ref{thm:signs-of-triug}),
by \ref{eq:CMB=XMA} we can not have a minus sign in the last equality; therefore
$$\measuredangle ABC\equiv\measuredangle BAX.$$

By construction, the line segments $[BM]$ and $[MX]$ do not cross the line $(AC)$.
Therefore the points $X$ and $B$ lie on the same side of $(AC)$ (see \ref{cor:half-plane});
in particular, $X\notin (AC)$.
\qeds


\parit{Proof of transversal property; ``only-if'' part.} 
Assume contrary; that is, equality \ref{A B C + B C D} holds, but $(AB)\z\nparallel(C D)$.
Then there is a unique point $Z\z\in (AB)\z\cap(C D)$.

Note that the triangle $ZBC$ is nondegenerate. %???problem

By Lemma \ref{lem:2angles1}, 
there is a point $X\notin(ZB)$ such that 
\[\measuredangle CBX=\measuredangle BCZ.\eqlbl{C B X = B C Z}\]

\begin{wrapfigure}[4]{r}{43mm}
\centering
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(-0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/onlyif-transversal(1)}

\lbl[br]{9,2;$D$}
\lbl[t]{4,11;$X$}
\lbl[b]{38,20;$Z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Applying \ref{C B X = B C Z}, \ref{A B C + B C D}, and Exercise~\ref{ex:ABCO-line}, we get that 
\begin{align*}
2\cdot \measuredangle CBX&\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle BCZ\equiv
\\
&\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle BCD\equiv
\\
&\equiv -2\cdot \measuredangle ABC\equiv
\\
&\equiv -2\cdot \measuredangle ZBC\equiv
\\
&\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle CBZ.
\end{align*}
Applying Exercise~\ref{ex:ABCO-line} again, we get that $X\in(ZB)$ --- a contradiction.

\parit{``If''-part.}
Given points $A$, $B$, and $C$ there is unique line $(CD)$ such that \ref{A B C + B C D} holds.
Indeed, suppose there are two such lines $(CD)$ and $(CD')$, then
$$2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D)\equiv 2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D')\equiv0.
$$ 
Therefore 
$2\cdot\measuredangle B C D\equiv 2\cdot\measuredangle B C D'$
and by Exercise~\ref{ex:ABCO-line},  $D'\in (CD)$, or equivalently the line $(CD)$ coincides with the line $(CD')$.

From the ``only-if'' part we know that if \ref{A B C + B C D} holds then $(CD)\parallel(AB)$.
By Theorem \ref{thm:parallel} there is unique line thru $C$ that is parallel to $(AB)$.
Therefore it must be the same line $(CD)$ such that \ref{A B C + B C D} hold.

\medskip

Finally, if $(AB)\ne(C D)$ and $A$ and $D$ lie on the opposite sides of $(BC)$, then $\angle ABC$ and $\angle BCD$ have opposite signs.
Therefore
\[-\pi\z<\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D<\pi.\]
Applying \ref{A B C + B C D}, we get $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D=0$.

Similarly if $A$ and $D$ lie on the same side of $(BC)$,
then $\angle ABC$ and $\angle BCD$ the same sign.
Therefore
\[0<|\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D|<2\cdot\pi\]
and \ref{A B C + B C D} implies that $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D\z\equiv\pi$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:smililar+parallel}
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a nondegenerate triangle.
Assume $B'$ and $C'$ are points on sides $[AB]$ and $[AC]$ such that $(B'C')\parallel(BC)$.
Show that $\triangle ABC\sim\triangle AB'C'$.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:3sum}
In any $\triangle A B C$, we have
$$\measuredangle A B C+ \measuredangle B C A + \measuredangle C A B \equiv \pi.$$

\end{thm}

%(???

\parit{Proof.} 
First note that 
if $\triangle A B C$ is degenerate, then the equality follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:degenerate=pi}.
Further we assume that $\triangle A B C$ is nondegenerate.

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

By Lemma~\ref{lem:2angles1} there is a point $X$ that lies with $B$ on the same side of $(AC)$ such that 
$\measuredangle BAX\z=\measuredangle ABC$.
In particular 
\[2\cdot (\measuredangle XAB+\measuredangle ABC)\equiv 0.\]
By transversal property, we get that $(AX)\parallel (CB)$.

Now, let us apply the transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}) to the parallel lines $(BC)$ and $(AX)$ and their transversal $(CA)$.
Since $B$ and $X$ lie on the same side of $(CA)$, we have 
\[\measuredangle BCA+\measuredangle CAX\equiv \pi.\eqlbl{eq:ABC+CAB}\]

Since $\measuredangle BAX=\measuredangle ABC$,
we have 
\[\measuredangle CAX\equiv\measuredangle CAB+\measuredangle ABC\]
The latter identity and \ref{eq:ABC+CAB} imply the theorem.\qeds

\section*{Parallelograms}
\addtocontents{toc}{Parallelograms.}

A quadrilateral $ABCD$ in the Euclidean plane is called \index{quadrilateral!degenerate quadrilateral}\index{degenerate!quadrilateral}\emph{nondegenerate} if any three points from $A,B,C,D$ do not lie on one line.

A nondegenerate quadrilateral  is called a \index{parallelogram}\emph{parallelogram}
if its opposite sides are parallel.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:parallelogram}
If $\square A B C D$ is a parallelogram, then
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\measuredangle D A B= \measuredangle B C D$;
\item $AB=CD$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Since $(AB)\parallel (CD)$,
the points $C$ and $D$ lie on the same side of~$(AB)$.
Hence $\angle ABD$ and $\angle ABC$ have the same sign.

The same way we get that 
$\angle CBD$ and $\angle CBA$ have the same sign. 

}

Since $\measuredangle ABC\equiv -\measuredangle CBA$,
we get that the angles $DBA$ and $DBC$ have opposite signs; 
that is, $A$ and $C$ lie on opposite sides of~$(BD)$.


According to the transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}), 
$$\measuredangle B D C
\equiv 
-\measuredangle DBA
\quad
\text{and}
\quad 
\measuredangle DBC
\equiv 
-\measuredangle BDA.$$
By the ASA condition
$\triangle A B D\cong \triangle C D B$.
The latter implies both statements in the lemma.

Assume $ABCD$ is a quadrilateral such that
\[AB=CD=BC=DA.\]

A quadrilateral as in the exercise above is called a \index{rhombus}\emph{rhombus}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:diad-par}
Show that diagonals of a parallelogram intersect each other at their midpoints.
\end{thm}

A quadraliteral $ABCD$ is called a \index{rectangle}\emph{rectangle} if the angles $ABC$, $BCD$, $CDA$, and $DAB$ are right.
Note that according to the transversal property \ref{thm:parallel-2},
any rectangle is a parallelogram.

A rectangle with equal sides is called a \index{square}\emph{square}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:rectangle}
Show that the parallelogram $ABCD$ is a rectangle
if and only if $AC=BD$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:romb2}
Show that the parallelogram $ABCD$ is a rhombus
if and only if $(AC)\perp (BD)$.

Assume $\ell\parallel m$, and $X,Y\in m$.
Let $X'$ and $Y'$ denote the foot points of $X$ and $Y$ on~$\ell$.
Note that $\square XYY'X'$ is a rectangle.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:parallelogram}, $XX'=YY'$.
That is, any point on $m$ lies on the same distance from $\ell$.
This distance is called the \index{distance!between parallel lines}\emph{distance between} $\ell$ and~$m$.
