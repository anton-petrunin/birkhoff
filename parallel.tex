In consequence of Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:1}, 
any two distinct lines $\ell$ and $m$ have either one point in common or none. 
In the first case they are \index{intersecting lines}\emph{intersecting} (briefly $\ell\nparallel m$); 
in the second case, $\ell$ and $m$ are said to be \index{parallel!lines}\emph{parallel} (briefly, \index{36@\hskip.4mm$\parallel$\hskip.4mm, \hskip.4mm$\nparallel$\hskip.4mm}$\ell\parallel m$);
in addition, a line is always regarded as parallel to itself.

}

To emphasize that two lines on a diagram are parallel we will mark them with arrows of the same type.



\begin{thm}[\abs]{Proposition}\label{prop:perp-perp} Let $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ be three lines.
Assume that $n\perp m$ and $m\perp \ell$.
Then $\ell\parallel n$. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the contrary; 
that is, $\ell\nparallel n$.
Then there is a point, say $Z$, of intersection of $\ell$ and~$n$.
Then by Theorem~\ref{perp:ex+un},
$\ell=n$.
Since any line is parallel to itself, we have that $\ell\parallel n$ --- a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:parallel}
For any point $P$ and any line $\ell$,
there is a unique line $m$
that passes thru $P$ and is parallel to~$\ell$.
\end{thm}

The above theorem has two parts, existence and uniqueness.
In the proof of uniqueness, we will use the method of similar triangles.

\parit{Proof; existence.} 
Apply Theorem~\ref{perp:ex+un} two times,
first to construct the line $n$ thru $P$ that is perpendicular to $\ell$,
and second to construct the line $n$ thru $P$ that is perpendicular to~$m$.
Then apply Proposition~\ref{prop:perp-perp}.

\parit{Uniqueness.}
If $P\in\ell$, then $m=\ell$ by the definition of parallel lines.
Now, assume $P\notin\ell$.

Let us construct the lines $n\ni P$ and $m\ni P$ as in the proof of existence, so $m\parallel \ell$.

Assume there is yet another line $s\ni P$ parallel to~$\ell$.
Choose a point $Q\in s$ that lies with $\ell$ on the same side from~$m$.
Let $R$ be the footpoint of $Q$ on~$n$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-74}
\end{figure}

Let $D$ be the point of intersection of $n$ and~$\ell$.
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:perp-perp} $(QR)\parallel m$. 
Therefore, $Q$, $R$, and $\ell$ lie on the same side of~$m$. 
In particular, $R\in [P D)$.

Choose $Z\in [P Q)$ such that 
$$\frac{PZ}{PQ}=\frac{PD}{PR}.$$
By SAS similarity condition (or equivalently by Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4})
we have that $\triangle RPQ\sim \triangle DPZ$;
therefore $(Z D)\perp(P D)$.
It follows that $Z$ lies on $\ell$ and $s$ --- a contradiction.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:parallel-1}
Assume $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ are lines
such that $\ell\parallel m$ and $m\parallel n$.
Then $\ell\parallel n$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the contrary; that is, $\ell\nparallel n$.
Then there is a point $P\in \ell\cap n$.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel},
$n=\ell$ --- a contradiction.
\qeds

By the definition, we have that $\ell\parallel m$ if and only if $m\z\parallel \ell$.
Therefore, according to the above corollary, ``$\parallel$'' is an 
\index{equivalence relation}\emph{equivalence relation}.
That is, for any lines $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $\ell\parallel \ell$;
\item if $\ell\parallel m$, then $m\parallel \ell$;
\item if $\ell\parallel m$ and $m\parallel n$, then 
$\ell\parallel n$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:perp-perp}
Let $k$, $\ell$, $m$, and $n$ be lines such that $k\perp \ell$, $\ell\perp m$, and $m\perp n$.
Show that $k\nparallel n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:construction-parallel}
Make a ruler-and-compass construction of a line thru a given point that is parallel to a given line.
\end{thm}

\section{Reflection across a point}

Fix a point $O$.
If $O$ is the midpoint of a line segment $[XX']$, then we say that $X'$ is a reflection of $X$ across $O$.

The map $X\mapsto X'$ is uniquely defined; it is called a \index{reflection!across a point}\emph{reflection} across $O$.
In this case, $O$ is called the \index{center!of reflection}\emph{center of reflection}. 
We assume that $O'=O$; that is, $O$ is a reflection of itself across itself.
If the reflection across $O$ moves a set $S$ to itself, then we say that $S$ is \index{central symmetry}\emph{centrally symmetric} with respect to $O$. 

Recall that any motion is either direct or indirect;
that is, it either preserves or reverses the signs of angles (Section~\ref{direct motion}). 

\begin{thm}[\abs]{Proposition}\label{prop:point-reflection}
A reflection across a point is a direct motion.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Observe that if $X'$ is a reflection of $X$ across $O$, 
then $X$ is a reflection of $X'$.
In other words, the composition of the reflection with itself is the identity map.
In particular, any reflection across a point is a bijection.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{33mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-76}
\end{wrapfigure}

Fix two points $X$ and $Y$;
let $X'$ and $Y'$ be their reflections across $O$.
To check that the reflection is distance preserving, we need to show that $X'Y'=XY$.

We may assume that $X$, $Y$, and $O$ are distinct; otherwise, the statement is trivial.
By the definition of the reflection across $O$, we have that $OX=OX'$, $OY=OY'$, and the angles $XOY$ and $X'OY'$ are vertical;
in particular, $\measuredangle XOY\z=\measuredangle X'OY'$.
By SAS, $\triangle XOY\cong\triangle X'OY'$;
therefore $X'Y'=XY$.

By \ref{ex:3-reflections}, the reflection across $O$ is either direct or indirect.
It cannot be indirect since $\measuredangle XOY\z=\measuredangle X'OY'$;
therefore it is a direct motion.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\angle AOB$ is right.
Show that the composition of reflections across the lines $(OA)$ and $(OB)$ is a reflection across $O$.

Use this statement and Corollary~\ref{cor:reflection+angle} to build another proof of~\ref{prop:point-reflection}.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:parallel-point-reflection}
Let $\ell$ be a line, $Q\in \ell$, and $P$ an arbitrary point.
Suppose $O$ is the midpoint of $[PQ]$.
Then a line $m$ passing thru $P$ is parallel to $\ell$ if and only if $m$ is a reflection of $\ell$ across $O$.
\end{thm}

}

\parit{Proof; ``if'' part.}
Assume $m$ is a reflection of $\ell$ across $O$.
Suppose $\ell\nparallel m$; that is $\ell$ and $m$ intersect at a single point $Z$.
Denote by $Z'$ be the reflection of $Z$ across $O$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-80}
\end{figure}

The point $Z'$ lies on both lines $\ell$ and $m$.
It follows that $Z'=Z$ or equivalently $Z=O$.
In this case, $O\in \ell$ and therefore the reflection of $\ell$ across $O$ is $\ell$ itself;
that is, $\ell=m$ and in particular $\ell\parallel m$ --- a contradiction. 

\parit{``Only-if'' part.}
Let $\ell'$ be the reflection of $\ell$ across $O$.
According to the ``if'' part of the theorem, $\ell'\parallel \ell$.
Both lines $\ell'$ and $m$ pass thru $P$.
By uniqueness of parallel lines (\ref{thm:parallel}), if $m\parallel \ell$, then $\ell'=m$; whence the statement follows.

\section{Transversal property}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{25mm}
\centering
\vskip-10mm
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-82}
\end{wrapfigure}

If the line $t$ intersects each line $\ell$ and $m$ at one point, then we say that $t$ is a \index{transversal}\emph{transversal} to $\ell$ and~$m$.
For example, on the diagram, line $(CB)$ is a transversal 
to $(AB)$ and~$(CD)$.

}

\begin{thm}{Transversal property}\label{thm:parallel-2} 
$(AB)\parallel(C D)$ if and only if 
$$2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D)\equiv 0.
\eqlbl{A B C + B C D}$$ 
Equivalently, 
$$\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D
\equiv 
0
\quad
\text{or}
\quad
\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D
\equiv
\pi.$$

Moreover, if $(AB)\ne(C D)$, then in the first case, 
$A$ and $D$ lie on opposite sides of $(BC)$;
in the second case,
$A$ and $D$ lie on the same sides of~$(BC)$.
\end{thm}



\parit{Proof; ``only-if'' part.}
Denote by $O$ the midpoint of $[BC]$.

Assume $(AB)\parallel(C D)$.
According to Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel-point-reflection},
$(CD)$ is a reflection of $(AB)$ across $O$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{31mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-84}
\end{wrapfigure}

Let $A'$ be the reflection of $A$ across $O$.
Then $A'\in (CD)$ and by Proposition~\ref{prop:point-reflection} we have that
\[\measuredangle ABO=\measuredangle A'CO.\eqlbl{A B O = A' C O}\]
Note that 
\[\measuredangle ABO\equiv\measuredangle ABC,
\qquad
\measuredangle A'CO\equiv-\measuredangle BCA'.\eqlbl{eq:A B O= A B C}
\]
Since $A'$, $C$, and $D$ lie on one line, Exercise~\ref{ex:ABCO-line} implies that 
\[2\cdot \measuredangle BCD\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle BCA'.\eqlbl{eq:2BCD= 2BCA'}\]
Finally, \ref{A B O = A' C O}, \ref{eq:A B O= A B C}, and \ref{eq:2BCD= 2BCA'} imply \ref{A B C + B C D}.
\qeds

\parit{``If''-part.}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel} there is a unique line $(CD)$ thru $C$ that is parallel to $(AB)$.
From the ``only-if'' part we know that  \ref{A B C + B C D} holds.

On the other hand, there is a \textit{unique} line $(CD)$ such that \ref{A B C + B C D} holds.
Indeed, suppose there are two such lines $(CD)$ and $(CD')$, then
$$2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D)\equiv 2\cdot(\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D')\equiv0.
$$ 
Therefore 
$2\cdot\measuredangle B C D\equiv 2\cdot\measuredangle B C D'$
and by Exercise~\ref{ex:ABCO-line},  $D'\in (CD)$, or equivalently the line $(CD)$ coincides with $(CD')$.

Therefore if \ref{A B C + B C D} holds, then $(CD)\parallel (AB)$.


\parit{Last statement.}
If $(AB)\ne(C D)$ and $A$ and $D$ lie on the opposite sides of $(BC)$, then $\angle ABC$ and $\angle BCD$ have opposite signs.
Therefore
\[-\pi\z<\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D<\pi.\]
Applying \ref{A B C + B C D}, we get $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D=0$.

Similarly, if $A$ and $D$ lie on the same side of $(BC)$,
then $\angle ABC$ and $\angle BCD$ have the same sign.
Therefore
\[0<|\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D|<2\cdot\pi,\]
and \ref{A B C + B C D} implies that $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D\z\equiv\pi$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:smililar+parallel}
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a nondegenerate triangle, and $P$ lies between $A$ and $B$.
Suppose that a line $\ell$ passes thru $P$ and is parallel to $(AC)$.
Show that $\ell$ crosses the side $[BC]$ at another point, say $Q$, and 
\[\triangle ABC\sim\triangle PBQ.\]
In particular, 
\[\frac{PB}{AB}=\frac{QB}{CB}.\]

\section{Angles of triangles}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:3sum}
In any $\triangle A B C$, we have
$$\measuredangle A B C+ \measuredangle B C A + \measuredangle C A B \equiv \pi.$$

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
If $\triangle A B C$ is degenerate, then the equality follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:degenerate=pi}.
Now, assume that $\triangle A B C$ is nondegenerate.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{23mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-86}
\end{wrapfigure} 

Let $X$ be the reflection of $C$ across the midpoint $M$ of $[AB]$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:point-reflection}
$\measuredangle BAX\z=\measuredangle ABC$.
Note that $(AX)$ is a reflection of $(CB)$ across $M$;
therefore by Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel-point-reflection}, $(AX)\z\parallel (CB)$.

Since $[BM]$ and $[MX]$ do not intersect $(CA)$,
the points $B$, $M$, and $X$ lie on the same side of $(CA)$.
Applying the transversal property for the transversal $(CA)$ to $(AX)$ and $(CB)$, we get that 
\[\measuredangle BCA+\measuredangle CAX\equiv \pi.\eqlbl{eq:ABC+CAB}\]

Since $\measuredangle BAX=\measuredangle ABC$,
we have 
\[\measuredangle CAX\equiv\measuredangle CAB+\measuredangle ABC.\]
The latter identity and \ref{eq:ABC+CAB} imply the theorem.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:|3sum|}

$$|\measuredangle A B C|+ |\measuredangle B C A| + |\measuredangle C A B| = \pi$$

\section{Parallelograms}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{26mm}

\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-94}
\end{wrapfigure}

A quadrangle $ABCD$ in the Euclidean plane is called \index{quadrangle!degenerate quadrangle}\index{degenerate!quadrangle}\emph{nondegenerate} if no three points from $A,B,C,D$ lie on one line.

}

A nondegenerate quadrangle  is called a \index{parallelogram}\emph{parallelogram}
if its opposite sides are parallel.



\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:parallelogram}
Any parallelogram is centrally symmetric with respect to a midpoint of one of its diagonals.

In particular, if $\square A B C D$ is a parallelogram, then
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{lem:parallelogram:midpoint} its diagonals $[AC]$ and $[BD]$ intersect each other at their midpoints;
\item $\measuredangle A B C= \measuredangle C D A$;
\item $AB=CD$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{33mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-96}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.} Let $\square A B C D$ be a parallelogram.
Denote by $M$ the midpoint of $[AC]$.

Since $(AB)\parallel (CD)$, Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel-point-reflection} implies that $(CD)$ is a reflection of $(AB)$ across $M$.
In the same way, $(BC)$ is a reflection of $(DA)$ across $M$.
Since $\square A B C D$ is nondegenerate, it follows that $D$ is a reflection of $B$ across $M$; in other words, $M$ is the midpoint of $[BD]$.

The remaining statements follow since reflection across $M$ is a direct motion of the plane (see \ref{prop:point-reflection}).

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:4parallels}
Assume that point $P$ is distinct from vertices of a parallelogram $ABCD$.
Let $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ be lines thru points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ such that 
$a\parallel (CP)$,
$b\parallel (DP)$,
$c\parallel (AP)$, and
$d\parallel (BP)$.
Show that the lines $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ intersect at one point.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:romb}
Assume $ABCD$ is a quadrangle such that
\[AB=CD=BC=DA.\]
Show that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.
\end{thm}

A quadrangle as in the exercise above is called a \index{rhombus}\emph{rhombus}.

A quadrangle $ABCD$ is called a \index{rectangle}\emph{rectangle} if the angles $ABC$, $BCD$, $CDA$, and $DAB$ are right.
According to the transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}),
any rectangle is a parallelogram.

A rectangle with equal sides is called a \index{square}\emph{square}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:rectangle}
Show that a parallelogram $ABCD$ is a rectangle
if and only if $AC=BD$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:romb2}
Show that a parallelogram $ABCD$ is a rhombus
if and only if $(AC)\perp (BD)$.
\end{thm}

Assume $\ell\parallel m$, and $X,Y\in m$.
Let $X'$ and $Y'$ denote the footpoints of $X$ and $Y$ on~$\ell$.
Note that $\square XYY'X'$ is a rectangle.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:parallelogram}, $XX'=YY'$.
That is, any point on $m$ lies at the same distance from $\ell$.
This distance is called the \index{distance!between parallel lines}\emph{distance between} $\ell$ and~$m$.


\section{Method of coordinates}

The following exercise is important;
it shows that our axiomatic definition agrees with the model described in Section~\ref{page:model}.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:coordinates} 
Let $\ell$ and $m$ be perpendicular lines in the Euclidean plane.
Given a point $P$, let $P_\ell$ and $P_m$ denote the footpoints of $P$ on $\ell$ and $m$ respectively.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that for any $X\in \ell$ and $Y\in m$ there is a unique point $P$ such that $P_\ell=X$ and $P_m=Y$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\addtocounter{enumi}{1}
\item
Show that 
$PQ^2=P_\ell Q_\ell^2+P_mQ_m^2$
for any pair of points $P$ and~$Q$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\addtocounter{enumi}{2}
\item Conclude that the plane is isometric to $(\mathbb{R}^2,d_2)$; see \ref{ex:dist-square}.
\end{enumerate}

Once this exercise is solved, we can apply 
the method of coordinates
to solve any problem in Euclidean plane geometry.
This method is powerful and universal;
it will be developed further in Chapter~\ref{chap:complex}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:abc}

to give an alternative proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:abc} in the Euclidean plane.

That is, prove that given the real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that

there is a triangle $ABC$
such that $a=BC$, $b=CA$, and $c=AB$.

Conclude that line can be defined as a subset of the coordinate plane of the following type:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Solutions of an equation $a\cdot x+b\cdot y=c$
for constants $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$.
\item\label{ex:line-coord:parameter} The set of points $(a\cdot t+c,b\cdot t+d)$ for constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$ and all $t\in \mathbb{R}$.

Show that if it is a circle, then $(-\tfrac a2,-\tfrac b2)$ is its center,
and $r\z=\tfrac12\cdot \sqrt{a^2+b^2-4\cdot c}$ is its radius.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:apolonnius}
Use the previous exercise to show that given a positive real number $k\ne1$,
the locus of points $M$ such that $AM=k\cdot BM$
