\chapter{Geometry of the h-plane}\label{chap:h-plane}
\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\begin{quote}}

In this chapter, we study the geometry of the plane described by the conformal disc model.
For briefness, this plane will be called the {}\emph{h-plane}.

We can work with this model directly from inside of the Euclidean plane. 
We may also use the axioms of neutral geometry since they all hold in the h-plane; the latter proved in the previous chapter.

\section*{Angle of parallelism}
\addtocontents{toc}{Angle of parallelism.}

Let $P$ be a point off an h-line~$\ell$. 
Drop a perpendicular $(PQ)_h$ from $P$ to $\ell$;
let $Q$ be its foot point.
Let $\phi$ be the smallest value such that the h-line $(PZ)_h$ with $|\measuredangle_h Q P Z|=\phi$ does not intersect~$\ell$.

The value $\phi$ is called the \index{angle!angle of parallelism}\emph{angle of parallelism} of $P$ to~$\ell$.
Clearly, $\phi$ depends only on the h-distance $s=PQ_h$.
Further, $\phi(s)\to \pi/2$ as $s\to 0$, 
and $\phi(s)\to0$ as $s\to\infty$.
(In the Euclidean geometry, the angle of parallelism is identically equal to~$\pi/2$.)

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{34mm}

\end{wrapfigure}

If $\ell$, $P$, and $Z$ are as above, then the h-line $m=(PZ)_h$ is called \index{asymptotically parallel lines}\emph{asymptotically parallel} to~$\ell$.
In other words, two h-lines are asymptotically parallel if they share one ideal point.
(In hyperbolic geometry, the term {}\emph{parallel lines} is often used for \index{asymptotically parallel lines}\emph{asymptotically parallel lines}; we do not follow this convention.)

Given $P\not\in\ell$, there are exactly two asymptotically parallel lines thru $P$ to $\ell$; 
the remaining parallel lines are called \index{parallel lines!ultra parallel lines}\emph{ultra parallel}.


On the diagram, the two solid h-lines passing thru $P$ are asymptotically parallel to~$\ell$;
the dashed h-line is ultra parallel to~$\ell$.








\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:angle-parallelism}
Let $Q$ be the foot point of $P$ on h-line~$\ell$.
Then
$$PQ_h=\tfrac12\cdot\ln \tfrac{1+\cos\phi}{1-\cos\phi},$$
where $\phi$ is the angle of parallelism of $P$ to~$\ell$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Applying a motion of the h-plane if necessary,
we may assume $P$ is the center of the absolute.
Then the h-lines thru $P$ are the intersections of Euclidean lines with the h-plane.

Let $A$ and $B$ denote the ideal points of~$\ell$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\angle APB$ 
is positive.
In this case 
$$\phi=\measuredangle QPB=\measuredangle APQ=\tfrac12 \cdot\measuredangle APB.$$

Let $Z$ be the center of the circle $\Gamma$ containing the h-line~$\ell$.
Set $X$ to be the point of intersection of the Euclidean segment $[AB]$ and the line~$(PQ)$.

Note that, $PX=\cos\phi$.
Therefore, by Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist},
$$PX_h=\ln \tfrac{1+\cos\phi}{1-\cos\phi}.$$

Note that both angles $PBZ$ and $BXZ$ are right.
Since the angle $PZB$ is shared, $\triangle ZBX\sim \triangle ZPB$.
In particular, 
$$ZX\cdot ZP=ZB^2;$$
that is, $X$ is the inverse of $P$ in~$\Gamma$.

The inversion in $\Gamma$ is the reflection of the h-plane across~$\ell$. 
Therefore
\begin{align*}
PQ_h&=QX_h=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot PX_h=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot\ln \tfrac{1+\cos\phi}{1-\cos\phi}.
\end{align*}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:angle-parallelism}
Let $ABC$ be an h-triangle and $\beta\z=|\measuredangle_h ABC|$.
Then the h-distance from $B$ to $(AC)_h$ is less than
\[\tfrac12\cdot\ln \frac{1+\cos\tfrac\beta2}{1-\cos\tfrac\beta2}.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\phi$ denotes the angle of parallelism of $B$ to~$(AC)_h$.
Note that $\phi>\tfrac\beta2$; therefore 
\[
\tfrac12\cdot\ln \frac{1+\cos\phi}{1-\cos\phi}
<
\tfrac12\cdot\ln \frac{1+\cos\frac\beta2}{1-\cos\frac\beta2}.\]
It remains to apply Proposition~\ref{prop:angle-parallelism}.

Let $ABC$ be an equilateral h-triangle with side $100$.
Show that 
\[|\measuredangle_h ABC|<\frac1{10\,000\,000\,000}.\]

\section*{Inradius of h-triangle}
\addtocontents{toc}{Inradius of triangle.}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:h-inradius}
The inradius of any h-triangle 
is less than $\tfrac12\cdot\ln3$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $I$ and $r$ be the h-incenter and h-inradius of $\triangle_hXYZ$.

Note that the h-angles 
$XIY$, 
$YIZ$ and 
$ZIX$
have the same sign.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that all of them are positive
and therefore
\[\measuredangle_hXIY+ 
\measuredangle_hYIZ+ 
\measuredangle_hZIX=2\cdot\pi
\]

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{44mm}
\centering

\end{wrapfigure}

We can assume that
$\measuredangle_hXIY\ge\tfrac23\cdot\pi$;
if not relabel $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. 

Since $r$ is the h-distance from $I$ to $(XY)_h$,
Corollary~\ref{cor:angle-parallelism} implies that
\begin{align*}r&<\tfrac12\cdot\ln \tfrac{1+\cos\frac\pi3}{1-\cos\frac\pi3}=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot\ln\frac{1+\tfrac12}{1-\tfrac12}=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot\ln 3.

Note that according to Lemma~\ref{lem:h-circle=circle},
any h-circle is a Euclidean circle which lies completely in the h-plane.
Further, any h-line is an intersection of the h-plane with the circle 
perpendicular to the absolute.

In this section we will describe the 
h-geometric meaning of the intersections 
of the other circles with the h-plane.

You will see that all these intersections have a {}\emph{perfectly round shape} in the h-plane.

One may think of these curves as trajectories of a car which drives in the plane with a fixed position of the steering wheel.

In the Euclidean plane, 
this way you either run along a circle or along a line.

In the hyperbolic plane, the picture is different.
If you turn the steering wheel to the far right, you will run along a circle.
If you turn it less, at a certain position of the wheel, you will never come back to the same point, but the path will be different from the line.
If you turn the wheel further a bit, you start to run along a path which stays at some fixed distance from an h-line.

\parbf{Equidistants of h-lines.}
Consider the h-plane with the absolute~$\Omega$.
Assume a circle $\Gamma$ intersects $\Omega$ in two distinct points, $A$ and~$B$. 
Let $g$ denotes the intersection of $\Gamma$ with the h-plane.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{46mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-212}
\end{wrapfigure}

Let us draw an h-line $m$ with the ideal points $A$ and~$B$.
According to Exercise~\ref{ex:ideal-line-unique}, $m$ is uniquely defined.

Consider any h-line $\ell$ perpendicular to~$m$;
let $\Delta$ be the circle containing~$\ell$.

Note that $\Delta\perp \Gamma$.
Indeed,
according to Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse-clines}, $m$ and $\Omega$ invert to themselves in~$\Delta$.
It follows that $A$ is the inverse of $B$ in~$\Delta$.
Finally, by Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse}, we get that $\Delta\perp \Gamma$.

Therefore, inversion in $\Delta$ sends both $m$ and $g$ to themselves.
For any two points $P',P\in g$ there is a choice of $\ell$ and $\Delta$ as above such that
$P'$ is the invese of $P$ in $\Delta$.
By the main observation (\ref{thm:main-observ}) the inversion in $\Delta$ is a motion of the h-plane. Therefore, all points of $g$ lie on the same distance from~$m$.

In other words, $g$ is the set of points which lie on a fixed h-distance and on the same side of~$m$.


Such a curve $g$ is called 
\index{equidistant}\emph{equidistant} to h-line~$m$.
In Euclidean geometry, the equidistant from a line is a line;
apparently in hyperbolic geometry the picture is different.

\parbf{Horocycles.}
If the circle $\Gamma$ touches the absolute from inside at one point $A$, then the complement $h=\Gamma\backslash\{A\}$ lies in the h-plane.
This set is called a \index{horocycle}\emph{horocycle}.
It also has a perfectly round shape in the sense described above.


Horocycles are the border case between circles and equidistants to h-lines.
A horocycle might be considered as a limit of circles 
thru a fixed point
with the centers running to infinity along a line.
The same horocycle is a limit of equidistants which pass thru fixed point to the h-lines running to infinity.

Find the leg of an isosceles right h-triangle inscribed in a horocycle.

\section*{Hyperbolic triangles}
\addtocontents{toc}{Hyperbolic triangles.}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:3sum-h}
Any nondegenerate hyperbolic triangle has a positive defect.
\end{thm}


\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{35mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-216}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix an h-triangle $ABC$.
According to Theorem~\ref{thm:3sum-a},
$$\defect(\triangle_hABC)\ge 0.\eqlbl{eq:defect<0}$$
It remains to show that in the case of equality, $\triangle_hABC$ degenerates.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that $A$ is the center of the absolute;
in this case 
$\measuredangle_h CAB\z=\measuredangle CAB$.
Yet we may assume that 
$$\measuredangle_h CAB,
\quad 
\measuredangle_h ABC,
\quad
\measuredangle_h BCA,
\quad
\measuredangle ABC,
\quad
\measuredangle BCA\ge 0.$$

Let $D$ be an arbitrary point in $[CB]_h$ distinct from $B$ and~$C$.
From Proposition~\ref{prop:arc(angle=tan)}, we have
$$\measuredangle ABC-\measuredangle_h ABC \equiv 
\pi-\measuredangle CDB
\equiv \measuredangle BCA-\measuredangle_h BCA.$$

From Exercise~\ref{ex:|3sum|}, we get that
$$\defect(\triangle_hABC)=2\cdot(\pi-\measuredangle CDB).$$
Therefore, if we have equality in \ref{eq:defect<0}, then $\measuredangle CDB=\pi$.
In particular, the h-segment $[BC]_h$ coincides with the Euclidean segment~$[BC]$.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:line/h-line},
the latter can happen only if the h-line $(BC)_h$ passes thru the center of the absolute ($A$);
that is, if $\triangle_hABC$ degenerates.
\qeds

The following theorem states, in particular, that nondegenerate hyperbolic triangles are congruent if their corresponding angles are equal.
In particular, in hyperbolic geometry, similar triangles have to be congruent.

{\sloppy 
\begin{thm}{AAA congruence condition}\label{thm:AAA}\index{AAA congruence condition}
Two nondegenerate h-triangles
 $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$
 are congruent if
$\measuredangle_hABC\z=\pm\measuredangle_hA'B'C'$,
$\measuredangle_hBCA\z=\pm\measuredangle_hB'C'A'$
and 
$\measuredangle_hCAB=\pm\measuredangle_hC'A'B'$.
\end{thm}

}

\parit{Proof.}
Note that if $AB_h=A'B'_h$, then the theorem follows from ASA.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{32mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-218}
\end{wrapfigure}

Assume the contrary. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $AB_h<A'B'_h$.
Therefore, we can choose the point $B''\in [A'B']_h$ such that $A'B''_h=AB_h$.

Choose an h-half-line $[B''X)$ so that 
\[\measuredangle_h A'B''X=\measuredangle_h A'B'C'.\]
According to Exercise~\ref{ex:parallel-abs}, $(B''X)_h\parallel(B'C')_h$.

By Pasch's theorem (\ref{thm:pasch}), $(B''X)_h$ intersects~$[A'C']_h$.
Let $C''$ denotes the point of intersection.

According to ASA, $\triangle_h ABC\cong\triangle_h A'B''C''$;
in particular, 
$$\defect(\triangle_h ABC)=\defect(\triangle_h A'B''C'').
\eqlbl{eq:defect=defect}$$

Applying Exercise~\ref{ex:defect} twice, we get that
$$\begin{aligned}
\defect(\triangle_h A'B'C')
&=
\defect(\triangle_h A'B''C'')
+
\\
&+\defect(\triangle_h B''C''C')+\defect(\triangle_h B''C'B').
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:defect+defect}$$
By Theorem~\ref{thm:3sum-h}, all the defects have to be positive.
Therefore
$$\defect(\triangle_h A'B'C')
>\defect(\triangle_h ABC).$$
On the other hand,
$$\begin{aligned}
\defect(\triangle_h A'B'C')
&= |\measuredangle_hA'B'C'|+|\measuredangle_hB'C'A'|+|\measuredangle_hC'A'B'|=
\\
&=|\measuredangle_hABC|+|\measuredangle_hBCA|+|\measuredangle_hCAB|=
\\
&=\defect(\triangle_h ABC)
 \end{aligned}$$
--- a contradiction.
\qeds

Recall that a bijection from a h-plane to itself is called \index{angle preserving transformation}\emph{angle preserving} if 
\[\measuredangle_h ABC= \measuredangle_h A'B'C'\]
for any $\triangle_h ABC$ and its image $\triangle_h A'B'C'$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:angle-preserving-hyp}
Show that any angle-preserving transformation of the h-plane is a motion.

\section*{Conformal interpretation}
\addtocontents{toc}{Conformal interpretation.}

Let us give another interpretation of the h-distance.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:conformal}
Consider the h-plane with the unit circle centered at~$O$ as the absolute.
Fix a point $P$ and let $Q$ be another point in the h-plane.
Set $x=PQ$ and $y=PQ_h$.
Then
$$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{y}{x}=\frac{2}{1-OP^2}.$$

\end{thm}

The above formula tells us that the h-distance from $P$ to a nearby point $Q$ is almost proportional to the Euclidean distance
with the coefficient $\tfrac{2}{1-OP^2}$. 
The value $\lambda(P)=\tfrac{2}{1-OP^2}$ is called the \index{conformal factor}\emph{conformal factor} of the h-metric.

The value $\tfrac1{\lambda(P)}=\tfrac12\cdot(1-OP^2)$
can be interpreted as the {}\emph{speed limit} at the given point~$P$. 
In this case the h-distance is the minimal time needed to travel from one point of the h-plane to another point.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{40mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-220}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
If $P=O$, then according to Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist}
$$\frac{y}{x}=\frac{\ln \tfrac{1+x}{1-x}}{x}\to 2\eqlbl{eq:O=P}$$
as $x\to0$.

If $P\ne O$, let $P'$ denotes the inverse of $P$ in the absolute.
Let $\Gamma$ denotes the circle with the center $P'$ 
perpendicular to the absolute.

According to the main observation (\ref{thm:main-observ}) and Lemma~\ref{lem:P-->O}, 
the inversion in $\Gamma$ is a motion of the h-plane which sends $P$ to~$O$.
In particular, if $Q'$ denotes the inverse of $Q$ in $\Gamma$, then $OQ'_h=PQ_h$.

Set $x'=OQ'$.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:inversion-sim},
$$\frac{x'}{x}=\frac{OP'}{P'Q}.$$
Since $P'$ is the inverse of $P$ in the absolute, we have that $PO\cdot OP'=1$.
Therefore, 
$$\frac{x'}{x}\to \frac{OP'}{P'P}=\frac{1}{1-OP^2}$$
as $x\to 0$.

Together with \ref{eq:O=P},
it implies that
$$\frac{y}{x}=\frac{y}{x'}\cdot \frac{x'}{x}\to \frac{2}{1-OP^2}$$
as $x\to 0$.\qeds

Here is an application of the lemma above.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:circum}
The circumference of an h-circle of the h-radius $r$ is 
$$2\cdot\pi\cdot\sinh r,$$
where \index{sh@$\sinh$}$\sinh r$ denotes the \index{hyperbolic sine}\emph{hyperbolic sine} of $r$;
that is,
$$\sinh r\df \frac{e^r-e^{-r}}{2}.$$

\end{thm}



Before we proceed with the proof, let us discuss the same problem in the Euclidean plane.

The circumference of a circle in the Euclidean plane
can be defined as the limit of perimeters of regular $n$-gons inscribed in the circle as $n\to \infty$.



Namely, let us fix $r>0$.
Given a positive integer $n$, consider $\triangle AOB$
such that
$\measuredangle AOB=\tfrac{2\cdot\pi}{n}$ and $OA=OB=r$.
Set $x_n=AB$.
Note that $x_n$ is the side of a regular $n$-gon inscribed in the circle of radius $r$. 
Therefore, the perimeter of the $n$-gon is $n\cdot x_n$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{47mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-222}
\end{wrapfigure}

The circumference of the circle with the radius $r$ 
might be defined as the limit
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} n\cdot x_n=2\cdot\pi\cdot r.\eqlbl{eq:2pir}$$
(This limit can be taken as the definition of~$\pi$.)

In the following proof, we repeat the same construction in the h-plane.

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the center $O$ of the circle is the center of the absolute.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist}, 
the h-circle with the h-radius $r$ is the Euclidean circle with the center $O$ and the radius 
$$a=\frac{e^r-1}{e^r+1}.$$

Let $x_n$ and $y_n$ denote the side lengths of the regular $n$-gons inscribed in the circle in the Euclidean and hyperbolic plane correspondingly.

Note that $x_n\to0$ as $n\to\infty$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:conformal},
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{y_n}{x_n}
&=\frac{2}{1-a^2}.
\end{align*}

Applying \ref{eq:2pir},
we get that the circumference of the h-circle can be found the following way:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\infty}n\cdot y_n
&=\frac{2}{1-a^2}\cdot\lim_{n\to\infty}n\cdot x_n=
\\
&=\frac{4\cdot\pi\cdot a}{1-a^2}=
\\
&=\frac{4\cdot\pi\cdot\left(\frac{e^r-1}{e^r+1}\right)}{1-\left(\frac{e^r-1}{e^r+1}\right)^2}=
\\
&=2\cdot\pi\cdot\frac{e^{r}-e^{-r}}{2}=
\\
&=2\cdot\pi\cdot\sinh r.
\end{align*}
\qedsf

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:circum}
Let $\circum_h(r)$ denotes the circumference of the h-circle of the h-radius~$r$.
Show that 
$$\circum_h(r+1)>2\cdot \circum_h(r)$$

\section*{Pythagorean theorem}
\addtocontents{toc}{Pythagorean theorem.}

Recall that $\cosh$ denotes \index{ch@$\cosh$}\index{hyperbolic cosine}\emph{hyperbolic cosine};
that is, the function defined by
$$\cosh x\df \tfrac{e^x+e^{-x}}2.$$

\begin{thm}{Hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem}\label{thm:pyth-h-poincare}
Assume that $ACB$ is an h-triangle with right angle at~$C$.
Set 
\[a=BC_h,
\quad 
b=CA_h
\quad\text{and}\quad
c=AB_h.\]
Then
\[\cosh c=\cosh a\cdot\cosh b.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:pyth-h-poincare}\]

\end{thm}

The formula \ref{eq:thm:pyth-h-poincare} will be proved by means of direct calculations.
Let us discuss the limit cases of this formula.

Note that $\cosh x$ can be written using the Taylor expansion
\[\cosh x=1+\tfrac1{2}\cdot x^2+\tfrac1{24}\cdot x^4+\dots.\]

It follows that if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are small, then
\begin{align*}
1+\tfrac1{2}\cdot c^2&\approx \cosh c=\cosh a\cdot\cosh b\approx
\\
&\approx(1+\tfrac1{2}\cdot a^2)\cdot (1+\tfrac1{2}\cdot b^2)
\approx 
\\
&\approx
1+\tfrac1{2}\cdot (a^2+b^2).
\end{align*}
In other words, the original Pythagorean theorem (\ref{thm:pyth}) is a limit case of the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem for small triangles.

For large $a$ and $b$ the terms $e^{-a}$ and $e^{-b}$ are neglectable.
In this case we have the following approximations:
\begin{align*}
\cosh a\cdot\cosh b&\approx \tfrac{e^a}2\cdot\tfrac{e^b}2=
\\
&=\tfrac{e^{a+b-\ln 2}}{2}\approx
\\
&\approx \cosh(a+b-\ln 2).
\end{align*}
Therefore $c\approx a+b-\ln 2$. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:c+1>a+b}
Assume that $ACB$ is an h-triangle with right angle at~$C$.
Set $a=BC_h$, $b=CA_h$, and $c=AB_h$.
Show that
\[c+\ln 2>a+b.\]

\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{43mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-224}
\end{wrapfigure}

In the proof of the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem we use the following formula from Exercise~\ref{ex:cosh}:
\[\cosh AB_h=\frac{AB\cdot A'B'+AB'\cdot A'B}{AA'\cdot BB'},\]
here $A$, $B$ are h-points distinct from the absolute and $A'$, $B'$ are their inversions in the absolute.
This formula is derived in the hints.


\parit{Proof of the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem.}
We assume that absolute is a unit circle.
By the main observation (\ref{thm:main-observ}) we can assume that $C$ is the center of absolute.
Let $A'$ and $B'$ denote the inverses of $A$ and $B$ in the absolute.

Set $x=BC$, $y=AC$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist}
\begin{align*}
a&=\ln \tfrac{1+x}{1-x},
&
b&=\ln \tfrac{1+y}{1-y}.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\[\begin{aligned}
\cosh a&=\tfrac12\cdot (\tfrac{1+x}{1-x}+\tfrac{1-x}{1+x})=
&&&&&
\cosh b&=\tfrac12\cdot (\tfrac{1+y}{1-y}+\tfrac{1-y}{1+y})=
\\
&=\tfrac{1+x^2}{1-x^2},
&&&&&
&=\tfrac{1+y^2}{1-y^2}.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{cosha+coshb}
\]

Note that 
\begin{align*}
B'C&=\tfrac1x,
&
A'C&=\tfrac1y.
\intertext{Therefore}
BB'&=\tfrac1x-x,
&
AA'&=\tfrac1y-y.
\intertext{Since the triangles $ABC$, $A'BC$, $AB'C$, $A'B'C$ are right, the original Pythagorean theorem (\ref{thm:pyth}) implies}
AB&=\sqrt{x^2+y^2},
&
AB'&=\sqrt{\tfrac1{x^2}+y^2},
\\
A'B&=\sqrt{x^2+\tfrac1{y^2}},
&
A'B'&=\sqrt{\tfrac1{x^2}+\tfrac1{y^2}}.
\end{align*}

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:cosh},
\[
\begin{aligned}
\cosh c&= \frac{AB\cdot A'B'+AB'\cdot A'B}{AA'\cdot BB'}=
\\
&=
\frac{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\cdot \sqrt{\tfrac1{x^2}
+\tfrac1{y^2}}+\sqrt{\tfrac1{x^2}+y^2}\cdot \sqrt{x^2+\tfrac1{y^2}}}
{(\tfrac1y-y)\cdot (\tfrac1x-x)}=
\\
&=\frac{x^2+y^2+1+x^2\cdot y^2}
{(1-y^2)\cdot (1-x^2)}=
\\
&=\frac{1+x^2}
{1-x^2}\cdot
\frac{1+y^2}
{1-y^2}.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{coshc}
\]
Finally note that \ref{cosha+coshb} and \ref{coshc} imply \ref{eq:thm:pyth-h-poincare}.
