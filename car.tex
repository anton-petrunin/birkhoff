Geometric constructions have great pedagogical value 
as an introduction to mathematical proofs.
The geometric constructions were introduced at the end of Chapter~\ref{chap:perp}
and since that moment they were used everywhere in the book.

In this chapter, we briefly discuss classical geometric constructions.

\section*{Classical problems}
\addtocontents{toc}{Classical problems.}

In this section, we list a couple of classical construction problems;
each known for more than a thousand years. 

The solutions of the following two problems are quite nontrivial.

\begin{thm}{Problem of Brahmagupta} 
Construct an inscribed quadrangle with given sides.
\end{thm}


 
\begin{thm}{Problem of Apollonius} Construct a circle that is tangent to three given circles.
\end{thm}

{

\end{wrapfigure}

Several solutions of this problem are presented in \cite{hadamard}. 
The following exercise is a simplified version of the problem of Apollonius, which is still nontrivial.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:simple-apollonius}
Construct a circle that passes thru a given point and is tangent to two intersecting lines.
\end{thm}

}


The following three problems cannot be solved in principle; 
that is, the needed compass-and-ruler construction does not exist.



\parbf{Doubling the cube.} {\it Construct the side of a new cube 
that has the volume twice as big as the volume of a given cube.} 

\medskip

In other words, 
given a segment of the length $a$,
one needs to construct a segment of length~$\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot a$.

\parbf{Squaring the circle.} {\it Construct a square with the same area as a given circle.} 

\medskip

If $r$ is the radius of the given circle, we need to construct a segment of length~$\sqrt{\pi}\cdot r$. 

\parbf{Angle trisection.} 
{\it Divide the given angle into three equal angles.}

\medskip

In fact, there is no compass-and-ruler construction that trisects angle with measure~$\tfrac\pi3$. 
The existence of such a construction would imply constructability of a regular 9-gon which is prohibited by the following famous result:

A \index{regular $n$-gon}\emph{regular $n$-gon} inscribed in a circle with center $O$ is a sequence of points $A_1\dots A_n$ on the circle such that 
\[\measuredangle A_nOA_1=\measuredangle A_1OA_2=\dots=\measuredangle A_{n-1}OA_n=\pm\tfrac2n\cdot \pi.\]
The points $A_1,\dots, A_n$ are \index{vertex!of a regular $n$-gon}\emph{vertices},
the segments $[A_1A_2], \z\dots, [A_nA_1]$ are \index{side!of a regular $n$-gon}\emph{sides} 
and the remaining segments $[A_iA_j]$ are \index{diagonal!of a regular $n$-gon}\emph{diagonals} of the $n$-gon.

Construction of a regular $n$-gon, therefore, is reduced to the construction of an angle with size $\tfrac2n\cdot \pi$.

\begin{thm}{Gauss--Wantzel theorem}
A regular $n$-gon can be constructed with a ruler and a compass 
if and only if 
$n$ is the product of a power of $2$ and any number of distinct Fermat primes.
\end{thm}

A \index{Fermat prime}\emph{Fermat prime} is a prime number of the form $2^k+1$ for some integer~$k$.
Only five Fermat primes are known  today:
$$3, 5, 17, 257, 65537.$$
For example, 
\begin{itemize}
\item one can construct a regular 340-gon since $340=2^2\cdot 5\cdot 17$ and $5$, as well as $17$, are Fermat primes;
\item one cannot construct a regular 7-gon since $7$ is not a Fermat prime;
\item one cannot construct a regular 9-gon; 
altho $9=3\cdot 3$ is a product of two Fermat primes, 
these primes are not distinct.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The impossibility of these constructions 
was proved only in the $19^\text{th}$ century.
The method used in the proofs is indicated in the next section.

\section*{Constructible numbers}
\addtocontents{toc}{Constructible numbers.}

In the classical compass-and-ruler constructions initial configuration can be completely described by a finite number of points;
each line is defined by two points on it and each circle is described by its center and a point on it (equivalently, you may describe a circle by three points on it).

In the same way, the result of construction can be described by a finite collection of points.

We may always assume that the initial configuration has at least two points;
if not, we could add one or two points to the configuration.
Moreover, applying a scaling to the whole plane, we can assume that the first two points in the initial configuration lie at distance 1 from each other.

In this case, we can choose a  coordinate system, such that one of the initial points is the origin $(0,0)$ and yet another initial point has the coordinates~$(1,0)$.
In this coordinate system,
the initial configuration of $n$ points is described by 
$2\cdot n-4$ numbers --- their coordinates $x_3,y_3,\z\dots,x_n,y_n$.

\medskip

It turns out that the coordinates of any point constructed with a compass and ruler
can be written thru the numbers $x_3,y_3,\z\dots,x_n,y_n$ using the four arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

For example, assume we want to find the points $X_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $X_2\z=(x_2,y_2)$ of the intersections of 
a line passing thru $A=(x_A,y_A)$ and $B\z=(x_B,y_B)$ and
the circle with center $O=(x_O,y_O)$ that passes thru the point $W=(x_W,y_W)$.
Let us write the equations of the circle and the line in the coordinates $(x,y)$:
$$
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
(x-x_O)^2+(y-y_O)^2&=(x_W-x_O)^2+(y_W-y_O)^2,
\\
(x-x_A)\cdot(y_B-y_A)&=(y-y_A)\cdot(x_B-x_A).
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
Note that coordinates $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ of the points $X_1$ and $X_2$ are solutions of this system.
Expressing $y$ from the second equation and substituting the result in the first one, gives us a quadratic equation in $x$, 
which can be solved using ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and  ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' only.


The same can be performed for the intersection of two circles. 
The intersection of two lines is even simpler; 
it is described as a solution of two linear equations and can be expressed using only four arithmetic operations;
the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' is not needed.

\medskip

On the other hand, it is easy to make compass-and-ruler constructions that produce segments of the lengths $a+b$ and $a-b$ from two given segments of lengths $a>b$.

To perform ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' consider the following diagram:
let $[AB]$ be a diameter of a circle; 
fix a point $C$ on the circle and let $D$ be the foot point of $C$ on~$[AB]$.
By Corollary~\ref{cor:right-angle-diameter}, the angle $ACB$ is right.
Therefore 
$$\triangle ABC\sim\triangle ACD\sim \triangle CBD.$$
It follows that $AD\cdot BD=CD^2$. 

{

\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{r}{37mm}

\end{wrapfigure}

Using this diagram, one should guess a solution to the following exercise.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:a2/b}
Given two line segments with lengths $a$ and $b$, give a ruler-and-compass construction of a segments with lengths $\tfrac {a^2}b$ and $\sqrt{a\cdot b}$.
\end{thm}

Taking $1$ for $a$ or $b$ above, we can produce 
$\sqrt a$, $a^2$, $\tfrac1b$.
Combining these constructions we can produce
$a\cdot b=(\sqrt{a\cdot b})^2$,
$\tfrac ab=a\cdot\tfrac 1b$.
In other words we produced a \index{compass-and-ruler calculator}\emph{compass-and-ruler calculator} which can do ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$'', and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

}

The discussion above gives a sketch of the proof of the following theorem:
 
\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:constructible-numbers}
Assume that the initial configuration of geometric construction is given by the points $A_1=(0,0)$, $A_2=(1,0)$, $A_3\z=(x_3,y_3),\z\dots,A_n=(x_n,y_n)$.
Then a point $X=(x,y)$ can be constructed using a compass-and-ruler construction
if and only if both coordinates $x$ and $y$ can be expressed from the integer numbers and $x_3$, $y_3$, $x_4$, $y_4,\z\dots,x_n,y_n$ using the arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$'', and the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.
\end{thm}

The numbers that can be expressed from the given numbers using the arithmetic operations and the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' are called \index{constructible numbers}\emph{constructible};
if the list of given numbers is not given, then we can only use the integers.

{\sloppy
The theorem above translates any compass-and-ruler construction problem into a purely algebraic language.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item The impossibility of a solution for doubling the cube problem states that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is not a constructible number.
That is $\sqrt[3]{2}$ cannot be expressed thru integers using
``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$'', and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

\item The impossibility of a solution for squaring the circle states that 
$\sqrt{\pi}$, or equivalently $\pi$, is not a constructible number.

\item The Gauss--Wantzel theorem says for which integers $n$ the number 
$\cos\tfrac{2\cdot\pi}n$ is constructible.
\end{itemize} 
Some of these statements might look evident, 
but rigorous proofs require some knowledge of abstract algebra (namely, field theory)
which is out of the scope of this book. 

}

In the next section, we discuss similar but simpler examples of impossible constructions with an unusual tool.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:5-gon}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item\label{ex:5-gon:a} Show that diagonal of regular pentagon is $\tfrac{1+\sqrt5}2$ times larger than its side.
 \item\label{ex:5-gon:b} Use (\ref{ex:5-gon:a}) to make a compass-and-ruler construction of a regular pentagon.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section*{Constructions with a set-square}
\addtocontents{toc}{Constructions with a set-square.}

{
\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}{26mm}
\vskip-8mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-288}
\end{wrapfigure}

A set-square is a construction tool shown in the picture ---
it can produce a line thru a given point
that makes the angles
$\tfrac\pi2$ or $\pm\tfrac\pi4$ 
to a given line and it can be also used as a ruler;
that is, it can produce a line thru a given pair of points.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:trisect-set-square}
Trisect a given segment with a set-square.
\end{thm}


Let us consider set-square constructions.
Following the same lines as in the previous section, we can define {}\emph{set-square constructible numbers}
and prove the following analog of Theorem~\ref{thm:constructible-numbers}:

}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Assume that the initial configuration of a geometric construction is given by the points $A_1=(0,0)$, $A_2=(1,0)$, $A_3\z=(x_3,y_3),\z\dots,A_n=(x_n,y_n)$.
Then a point $X=(x,y)$ can be constructed using a set-square construction
if and only if both coordinates $x$ and $y$ can be expressed from the integer numbers and $x_3$, $y_3$, $x_4$, $y_4,\z\dots,x_n$, $y_n$ using the arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', and ``$/$'' only. 
\end{thm}
 
Let us apply this theorem to show the impossibility of some constructions with a set-square.

Note that if all the coordinates $x_3,y_3,\dots,x_n,y_n$ are rational numbers, then the theorem above implies that with a set-square, one can only construct the points with rational coordinates.
A point with both rational coordinates is called \index{rational point}\emph{rational},
and if at least one of the coordinates is irrational, then the point is called \index{irrational point}\emph{irrational}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:equilateral triangle}
Show that an equilateral triangle in the Euclidean plane has at least one irrational point.

Conclude that with a set-square, one cannot construct an equilateral triangle with a given base.
\end{thm}

\section*{Verifications}
\addtocontents{toc}{Verifications.}

Suppose we need to verify that a given configuration is defined by a certain property. 
Is it possible to do this task by a geometric construction with given tools?
We assume that we can \emph{verify} that two constructed points coincide.

Evidently, if a configuration is constructible, then it is verifiable --- simply repeat the construction and check if the result is the same.
Some nonconstuctable configurations are verifiable.
For example, it does not pose a problem to verify that the given angle is trisected while it is impossible to trisect a given angle with ruler and compass.
A regular 7-gon provides another example of that type --- it is easy to verify, while Gauss--Wantzel theorem states that it is impossible to construct with ruler and compass.

Since we did not prove the impossibility of angle trisection and Gauss--Wantzel theorem, the following example might be more satisfactory.
It is based on Exercise~\ref{ex:equilateral triangle} which states that it is impossible to construct an equilateral with set-square only.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:equilateral triangle-verify}
Make a set-square construction verifying that a given triangle is equilateral.
\end{thm}

This observation leads to a source of impossible constructions in a stronger sense --- those that are even not verifiable.

The following example is closely related to Exercise~\ref{ex:circumtool}.
Recall that a \index{circumtool}\emph{circumtool} produces a circle passing thru any given three points
or a line if all three points lie on one line.


\parbf{Problem.}
\textit{Show that with a circumtool only,
it is impossible to verify that a given point is the center of a given circle~$\Gamma$.
In particular, it is impossible to construct the center with a circumtool only.}
\medskip

\parbf{Remark.}
In geometric constructions, we allow to choose some free points,
say any point on the plane, or a point on a constructed line, or a point that does not lie on a constructed line, 
or a point on a given line that does not lie on a given circle, and so on.

In principle, when you make such a free choice it is possible to make a right construction by accident.
Nevertheless, we do not accept such a coincidence as true construction; 
we say that a construction produces the center if it produces it for any free choices.


\parit{Solution.}\label{page:solution-for-ex:circumtool}
Arguing by contradiction, 
assume we have a verifying construction. 

Apply an inversion in a circle perpendicular to $\Gamma$ to the whole construction.
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse-clines},
the circle
$\Gamma$ maps to itself.
Since the inversion sends a circline to a circline, we get that the whole  construction is mapped to an equivalent construction; 
that is, a constriction with a different choice of free points.

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:inv-center not=center-inv}, 
the inversion sends the center of $\Gamma$ to another point.
However, this construction claims that this another point is the center --- a contradiction.
\qeds

A similar example of impossible constructions for a ruler and a parallel tool
 is given in Exercise~\ref{ex:affine-perp}.
 
Let us discuss another example for a ruler-only construction.
Note that ruler-only constructions are invariant with respect to the projective transformations. 
In particular, to solve the following exercise, it is sufficient to construct a projective transformation that fixes two points and moves their midpoint.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:midpoint-proj}
Show that there is no ruler-only construction verifying that a given point is a  midpoint of a given segment.
In particular, it is impossible to construct the midpoint only with a ruler.
\end{thm}

The following theorem is a stronger version of the exercise above.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:circle-center-proj}
There is no ruler-only construction verifying that a given point is the center of a given circle.
In particular, it is impossible to construct the center only with a ruler.
\end{thm}

The proof uses the construction in Exercise~\ref{ex:cone}.

\parit{Sketch of the proof.}
The same argument as in the problem above shows that 
it is sufficient to construct a projective transformation 
that sends the given circle $\Gamma$ to a circle $\Gamma'$ such that the center of $\Gamma'$ is not the image of the center of~$\Gamma$.

Choose a circle $\Gamma$ that lies in the plane $\Pi$ in the Euclidean space.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:inversion-3d}, 
the inverse of a circle in a sphere is a circle or a line.
Fix a sphere $\Sigma$ with the center $O$ so that the inversion $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$
is a circle and the plane $\Pi'$ containing $\Gamma'$ is not parallel to $\Pi$;
any sphere $\Sigma$ in a general position will do.

Let $Z$ and $Z'$ denote the centers of $\Gamma$ and~$\Gamma'$.
Note that  $Z'\z\notin(OZ)$.
It follows that the perspective projection $\Pi\to \Pi'$ with center $O$ sends $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma'$, but $Z'$ is not the image of~$Z$.

\section*{Comparison of construction tools}
\addtocontents{toc}{Comparison of construction tools.}

We say that one set of tools is \emph{stronger} than another if any configuration of points that can be constructed with the second set can be constructed with the first set as well.
If in addition, there is a configuration constructible with the first set, but not constructible with the second, then we say that the first set is {}\emph{strictly stronger} than the second.
Otherwise (that is, if any configuration that can be constructed with the first set can be constructed with the second), we say that the sets of tools are \emph{equivalent}. 

For example, \emph{Mohr--Mascheroni theorem} states that compass alone is equivalent to compass and ruler.
Note that one may not construct a line with a compass, but since we consider only configurations of points we do not have to.
One may think that a \emph{line is constructed} if we construct two points on it.

For sure compass and ruler form a stronger set than compass alone.
Therefore Mohr--Mascheroni theorem will follow once we solve the following two construction problems:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Given four points $X$, $Y$, $P$, and $Q$, construct the intersection of the lines $(XY)$ and $(PQ)$ with compass only.
\item  Given four points $X$, $Y$, and a circle $\Gamma$, construct the intersection of the lines $(XY)$ and $\Gamma$ with compass only.
\end{enumerate}
Indeed, once we have these two constructions, we can do every step of a compass-and-ruler construction using a compass alone.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:comparison}
Compare the following set of tools: (a) a ruler and compass, (b) a set-square, and (c) a ruler and a parallel tool.
\end{thm}

Another classical example is the so-called \emph{Poncelet--Steiner theorem};
it states that the set of compass and ruler is equivalent to ruler alone, provided that a single circle and its center are given.
