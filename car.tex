Geometric constructions has great pedagogical value 
as an introduction to mathematical proofs.
We were using construction problems 
everywhere starting from Chapter~\ref{chap:perp}.

In this chapter we briefly discuss the classical results in geometric constructions.

\section*{Classical problems}
\addtocontents{toc}{Classical problems.}

Here we list couple of classical construction problems;
each known for more than thousand years. 
The solutions of the following two problems are quite nontrivial.

\begin{thm}{Brahmagupta's problem} 
Construct an inscribed quadrilateral with given sides.
\end{thm}


 
\begin{thm}{Apollonius's problem} Construct a circle which is tangent to three given circles in a plane.
\end{thm}

{

\begin{lpic}[t(-9mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(3mm)]{pics/apollonius(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

The following exercise is a simplified version of Apollonius's problem, which is still nontrivial.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:simple-apollonius}
Construct a circle which pass through given point and tangent to two intersecting lines.
\end{thm}
}





The following three problems can not be solved in principle; 
that is, the needed compass-and-ruler construction does not exist.

\parbf{Doubling the cube.} {\it Construct the side of a new cube, 
which has volume twice bigger than the volume of the given cube.} 

\medskip

In other words, 
given a segment of length $a$
one needs to construct a segment of length $\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot a$.

\parbf{Squaring the circle.} {\it Construct a square with the same area as a given circle.} 

\medskip

If $r$ is the radius of the given circle, we need to construct a segment of length $\sqrt{\pi}\cdot r$. 

\parbf{Angle trisection.} 
{\it Divide the given angle into three equal angles.}

\medskip

In fact there is no compass-and-ruler construction which trisects angle with measure $\tfrac\pi3$. 
Existence of such construction would imply constructability of regular 9-gon which is prohibited by the following famous result.

\begin{thm}{Gauss--Wantzel theorem}
A regular $n$-gon is constructable with ruler and compass 
if and only if 
$n$ is the product of a power of $2$ and any number of distinct Fermat primes.
\end{thm}

The \index{Fermat prime}\emph{Fermat prime} is a prime numbers of the form $2^k+1$ for some integer $k$.
Only five Fermat primes are known  today:
$$3, 5, 17, 257, 65537.$$
For example, 
\begin{itemize}
\item one can construct a regular 34-gon since $34=2\cdot 17$ and $17$ is a Fermat prime;
\item one can not construct a regular 7-gon since $7$ is not a Fermat prime;
\item one can not construct a regular 9-gon; although $9=3\cdot 3$ is a product of two Fermat primes, these primes are not distinct.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

The impossibility of these constructions 
was proved only in 19th century.
The method used in the proofs is indicated in the next section.

\section*{Constructable numbers}
\addtocontents{toc}{Constructable numbers.}

In the classical compass-and-ruler constructions initial configuration can be completely described by a finite number of points;
each line is defined by two points on it and each circle is described by its center and a point on it (equivalently, you may describe a circle by tree points on it).

The same way the result of construction can be described by a finite collection of points.

Choose a  coordinate system, such that one of the initial points as the origin $(0,0)$ and yet an other initial point has coordinates $(1,0)$.
In this coordinate system,
the initial configuration of $n$ points is described by 
$2\cdot n-4$ numbers, their coordinates, say $(x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,\dots,x_n,y_n)$.
It is straightforward to show that coordinates of any point constructed 
can be written through the numbers $x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,\dots,x_n,y_n$ using the four arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

For example, assume we want to find the points $X_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $X_2\z=(x_2,y_2)$ of intersection of 
a line passing through $A=(x_A,y_A)$ and $B\z=(x_B,y_B)$ and
the circle with center $O=(x_O,y_O)$ which pass through a point $W=(x_W,y_W)$.
Let us write the equations of these circle and line in the coordinates $(x,y)$:
$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
(x-x_O)^2+(y-y_O)^2=(x_W-x_O)^2+(y_W-y_O)^2    
\\
(x-x_A)\cdot(y_B-y_A)=(y-y_A)\cdot(x_B-x_A)  
\end{matrix}
\right.
$$
Expressing $y$ from the second equation and substituting the result in the first one, gives us a quadratic equation in $x$, 
which can be solved using ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and  ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' only.

The same can be performed for the intersection of two circles. 
The intersection of two lines is even simpler; 
it described as a solution of two linear equations and can be expressed using only four arithmetic operations;
the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' is not needed.

Summarizing, the coordinates of any point which can be obtained by a compass-and-ruler construction can be expressed in terms of $x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,\dots,x_n,y_n$ and integers using only ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

On the other hand, it is easy to produce  compass-and-ruler constructions which produce a segment of length $a+b$ and $a-b$ from two given segments of lengths $a>b$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{47mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-5mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(3mm)]{pics/geom-calc(1)}
\lbl[r]{0,22;$A$}
\lbl[l]{42,22;$B$}
\lbl[t]{9,20;$D$}
\lbl[rb]{9,38;$C$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

To perform ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''
and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$'' consider the following diagram.
Let $[AB]$ be diameter of a circle; 
Consider point $C$ on the circle and let $D$ be the foot point of $C$ on $[AB]$.
Note that 
$$\triangle ABC\sim\triangle ACD\sim \triangle BDC.$$
It follows that $AD\cdot DC=BD^2$.  

Using this diagram, one should guess the compass-and-ruler constructions 
which produce a segments of lengths
$\sqrt{a\cdot b}$ and $\tfrac {a^2}b$.
Say to construct  $\sqrt{a\cdot b}$ one can do the following:
(1) construct points $A$, $B$ and $D\in [AB]$
such that $AD=a$ and $BD=b$
(2) construct a circle $\Gamma$ with diameter $[AB]$
(3) draw the perpendicular $\ell$ through $D$ to $(AB)$ 
(4) let $C$ be an intersection of $\Gamma$ and $\ell$.
Then $DC= \sqrt{a\cdot b}$.

Taking $1$ for $a$ or $b$ above we can produce 
$\sqrt a$, $a^2$, $\tfrac1b$.
Further combining these constructions we can produce
$a\cdot b=(\sqrt{a\cdot b})^2$,
$\tfrac ab=a\cdot\tfrac 1b$.
In other words we produced a compass-and-ruler calculator,
which can do ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$'' and ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.

The discussion above gives a rough sketch of the proof of the following theorem:
 
\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:constructable-numbers}
Assume that initial configuration of geometric construction is given by points $A_1=(0,0)$, $A_2=(1,0)$, $A_3=(x_3,y_3),\z\dots,A_n=(x_n,y_n)$.
Then a point $X=(x,y)$ can be constructed using a compass-and-ruler construction
if and only if both coordinates $x$ and $y$ can be expressed from $x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,\dots,x_n,y_n$ using the arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$'' and the square root ``$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$''.
\end{thm}

This theorem translates any compass-and-ruler construction problem 
into purely algebraic language --- we need to decide if the given number is constructable.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Impossibility of solution for doubling cube problem states that $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is not a constructable number.
\item Impossibility of solution for squaring the circle states that 
$\sqrt{\pi}$, or equivalently $\pi$, is not a constructable number.
\item Gauss--Wantzel theorem tells for which integers $n$ the number 
$\cos\tfrac{2\cdot\pi}n$ is constructable.
\end{itemize} 
Some of these statements might look evident, 
but a rigorous proofs require some knowledge of field theory
which is out of scope of this book. 

In the next section we discuss a similar but simpler examples of impossible constructions with unusual tools.

\section*{Constructions with set square}
\addtocontents{toc}{Constructions with set square.}

\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{o}{19mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-3mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/set-square(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Set square is a construction tool 
which can produce a line through the given point
which makes angle
$\tfrac\pi2$ or $\pm\tfrac\pi4$ 
with the given line.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:trisect-set-square}
Trisect the given segment with ruler and set square.
\end{thm}


Consider ruler-and-set-square construction.
Using the same idea as in the previous section,
we can define {}\emph{ruler-and-set-square constructable numbers}
and prove the following analog of  Theorem~\ref{thm:constructable-numbers}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Assume that initial configuration of geometric construction is given by points $A_1=(0,0)$, $A_2=(1,0)$, $A_3=(x_3,y_3),\z\dots,A_n=(x_n,y_n)$.
Then a point $X=(x,y)$ can be constructed using a ruler-and-set-square construction
if and only if both coordinates $x$ and $y$ can be expressed from $x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4,\dots,x_n,y_n$ using the arithmetic operations ``$+$'', ``$-$'', ``$\cdot$'', ``$/$''. 
\end{thm}

Note that if all the coordinates $x_2,y_2,\dots,x_n,y_n$ are rational numbers then the theorem above implies that with ruler and set square one can only construct the points with rational coordinates.
A point with both rational coordinates is called \index{rational point}\emph{rational},
and if at least one of the coordinates is irrational, then the point is called \index{irrational point}\emph{irrational}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:equilateral triangle}
Show that an equilateral triangle in Euclidean plane has at least one irrational point.

Conclude that with ruler and set square one can not construct an equilateral triangle.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:equilateral triangle-verify}
Make a ruler-and-set-square construction which verifies if the given triangle is  equilateral.
(We assume that we can ``verify'' if two constructed points coincide.) 
\end{thm}


\section*{More impossible constructions}
\addtocontents{toc}{More impossible constructions.}

In this section we discuss yet an other source of impossible constructions. 

Recall that a \index{circumtool}\emph{circumtool} produces a circle passing through given three points
or a line if all three points lie on one line.
Let us restate Exercise~\ref{ex:circumtool}.

\parbf{Exercise.}
\textit{Show that with circumtool only,
it is impossible to construct the center of given circle $\Gamma$.}
\medskip

\parbf{Remark.}
In geometric constructions we allow to choose some free points,
say any point on the plane, or a point on a constructed line, or a point which does not lie on a constructed line and so on.

In principle, when you make such a free choice it is possible to mark the center of $\Gamma$ by an accident.
Nether the less, we do not accept such coincidence as true construction; 
we say that a construction produce the center if it produce it for any free choices.


\parit{Solution.}\label{page:solution-for-ex:circumtool}
Arguing by contradiction, 
assume we have a construction of the center. 

Apply to whole construction an inversion in a circle perpendicular to  $\Gamma$.
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse-clines}, 
$\Gamma$ maps to itself.
Since inversion sends circline to circline, we get that all construction is mapped to an equivalent construction; 
that is, a constriction with different choice of free points.

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:inv-center not=center-inv}, 
the inversion sends the center of $\Gamma$ to an other point.
That is, following the same construction, we can end up at a different point, a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:center-verify}
Show that there is no circumtool-only construction which verifies if the given point is the center of given circle.
(We assume that we can only ``verify'' if two constructed points coincide.) 
\end{thm}

A similar example of impossible constructions for ruler and parallel tool
 is given in Exercise~\ref{ex:affine-perp}.
 
Let us discuss yet an other example for ruler-only construction.
Note that ruler-only constructions are invariant with respect to the projective transformations. 
In particular, to solve the following exercise, it is sufficient to construct a projective transformation which fix two points $A$ and $B$ and moves its midpoint.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:midpoint-proj}
Show that  midpoint of given segment can not be constructed with ruler only.
\end{thm}

The following theorem is a stronger version of the exercise above.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:circle-center-proj}
The center of given circle can not be constructed with ruler only.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
To prove this theorem 
it is sufficient to construct a projective transformation 
which sends the given circle $\Gamma$ to a circle, say $\Gamma'$ but the center of $\Gamma'$ is not the image of center of $\Gamma$.

Let $\Gamma$ be a circle which lies in the plane $\Pi$ in the Euclidean space.

By Theorem~\ref{thm:inverion-3d}, 
inversion of circle in a sphere is a circle or a line.
Fix a sphere $\Sigma$ with center $O$ so that the inversion $\Gamma'$ of $\Gamma$
is a circle and the plane $\Pi'$ containing $\Gamma'$ is not parallel to $\Pi$;
any sphere $\Sigma$ in general position will do.

Denote by $Z$ and $Z'$ the centers of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$.
Note that  $Z'\z\notin(OZ)$.
It follows that the perspective projection $\Pi\to \Pi'$ with center at $O$ sends $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma'$, but $Z'$ is not the image of $Z$.
\qeds

\section*{Construction of polar}


Assume $\Gamma$ is a circle in the plane.
Given point $P$ consider two chords $[XX']$ and $[YY']$ of $\Gamma$
such that $(XX')\cap (YY')=P$.
Let $Z=(XY)\cap(X'Y')$ and $Z'=(XY')\cap(X'Y)$ and $p=(ZZ')$.
If $P\in \Gamma$ we assume that $p$ is the tangent to $\Gamma$ at $P$.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:polar}
The line $p=(ZZ')$ does not depend on the choice of chords.
Moreover $P\mapsto p$ is a duality (see page~\pageref{page:duality}).
\end{thm}

The line $p$ is called polar of $P$ with respect to $\Gamma$.
The same way the point $P$ is called polar of the line $p$ with respect to $\Gamma$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{30mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/polar(1)}
\lbl[t]{27,8;$P$}
\lbl[l]{15,0;$p$}
\lbl[rb]{1,6;$X$}
\lbl[ltw]{19.5,8;$X'$}
\lbl[b]{9,19;$Y$}
\lbl[b]{17.5,16;$Y'$}
\lbl[l]{14,24;$Z$}
\lbl[trw]{12,12;$Z'$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

We will not give a proof of this claim, but will try to use it in the constructions.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:tangent ruler}
Let $p$ be the polar line of point $P$ with respect to circle $\Gamma$.
Assume that $p$ intersects $\Gamma$ at points $V$ and $W$.
Show that the lines $(PV)$ and $(PW)$ are tangent to $\Gamma$.

Come up with a ruler-only construction of the tangent lines to the given circle through the given point.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:concentric-circ}
Assume two concentric circles $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ are given.
Construct the common center of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ with ruler only.
\end{thm}
