In this chapter we use inversive geometry 
to construct the model of hyperbolic plane --- an example of absolute plane which is not Euclidean.

Namely, we construct  so called \index{Poincar\'e disk model}\emph{Poincar\'e disk model} of hyperbolic plane.
This model was discovered by Beltrami in  \cite{beltrami} 
and popularized later by Poincar\'e. 
%(Despite common believe, Beltrami was not the first who came up with the concept of model in this context,  in particular Lobachevsky modeled Euclidean plane in Hyperbolic space.)

The figure above shows the Poincar\'e disk model of hyperbolic plane which is cut into congruent triangles with angles $\tfrac\pi3$, $\tfrac\pi3$ and $\tfrac\pi4$.

\section*{Poincar\'e disk model}
\addtocontents{toc}{Poincar\'e disk model.}

In this section we give new names for some objects in the Euclidean plane
which will represent lines, angle measures, distances in the  hyperbolic plane.

\parbf{Hyperbolic plane.}
Let us fix a circle on the Euclidean plane 
and call it \index{absolute}\emph{absolute}.
The set of points inside the absolute will be called \index{hyperbolic plane}\index{plan!hyperbolic plane}\emph{hyperbolic plane} (or \index{plane!h-plane}\index{h-plane}\emph{h-plane}).

Note that the points on absolute do {}\emph{not} belong to the h-plane.
The points in the h-plane will be also called \index{h-point}\emph{h-points}.

Often we will assume that the absolute is a unit circle.



\parbf{Hyperbolic lines.}
The intersections of h-plane with circlines perpendicular to the absolute are called {}\emph{hyperbolic lines} or \index{h-line}\emph{h-lines}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{58mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-4mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(-2mm)]{pics/APQB(1)}
\lbl[rt]{34,16;$P$}
\lbl[r]{32,29;$Q$}
\lbl[t]{39,10;$A$}
\lbl[b]{38.5,36.5;$B$}
\lbl[rb]{55,13;$\Gamma$}
\lbl[b]{20,15;h-plane}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

By Corollary~\ref{cor:h-line}, there is unique h-line which pass
through given two distinct h-points $P$ and $Q$.
This h-line will be denoted as $(PQ)_h$.

The arcs of hyperbolic lines will be called {}\emph{hyperbolic segments} or \index{h-segment}\emph{h-segments}.
An h-segment with endpoints $P$ and $Q$ will be denoted as $[PQ]_h$.

The subset of h-line on one side from a point will be called {}\emph{hyperbolic half-line} (or \index{h-half-line}\emph{h-half-line}).
More precisely, h-half-line is an intersection of h-plane with arc which perpendicular to the absolute with only one endpoint in the h-plane.
An h-half-line from $P$ passing through $Q$ will be denoted as $[PQ)_h$.

If $\Gamma$ is the circle containing the h-line $(PQ)_h$
then the points of intersection of $\Gamma$ with absolute are called 
\index{point!ideal point}\index{ideal point}\emph{ideal points} of $(PQ)_h$.
(Note that the ideal points of h-line do not belong to the h-line.)

Similarly a triangle in h-plane; i.e., ordered triple of h-points, say $(P,Q,R)$, will be denoted by $\triangle P Q R$.

So far $(PQ)_h$ is just a subset of h-plane;
below we will introduce h-distance and later we will show that  $(PQ)_h$ is a line for the h-distance in the sense of the Definition~\ref{def:line}. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:ideal-line-unique}
Show that the h-line is uniquely determined by its ideal points.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:1ideal-line-unique}
Show that the h-line is uniquely determined by one of its ideal points and one h-point on it.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:line/h-line}
Show that h-segment $[PQ]_h$ coincides with the Euclidean segment $[PQ]$
if and only if the line $(PQ)$ pass through  the center of the absolute.
\end{thm}





\parbf{Hyperbolic distance.}\label{h-dist}
Let $P$ and $Q$ be distinct h-points.
Denote by $A$ and $B$ be the ideal points of $(PQ)_h$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that on the Euclidean circle containing the h-line $(PQ)_h$, the points $A,P,Q,B$ appear in the same order.

Consider function 
$$\delta(P,Q)\df\frac{AQ\cdot BP}{QB\cdot PA}.$$
Note that right hand side is the cross-ratio, 
which appeared in Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}.
Set $\delta(P,P)=1$ for any h-point $P$.
Set 
$$PQ_h\df\ln[\delta(P,Q)].$$

The proof that $PQ_h$ is a metric on h-plane will be given below.
For now it is just a function which returns a real value $PQ_h$ for any pair of h-points $P$ and $Q$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:h-dist-eq}
Let $O$ be the center of the absolute and the h-points $O$, $X$ and $Y$ lie on the one h-line in the same order.
Assume $OX\z=XY$.
Prove that $OX_h<XY_h$.
\end{thm}


\parbf{Hyperbolic angles.}\label{h-angle measure}
Consider three h-points $P$, $Q$ and $R$
such that $P\ne Q$ and $R\ne Q$.
The hyperbolic angle $\angle_h PQR$ is ordered pair of h-half-lines $[QP)_h$ and $[QR)_h$.

Let $[QX)$ and $[QY)$ be (Euclidean) half-lines 
which are tangent to $[QP]_h$ and $[QR]_h$ 
at $Q$.
Then the \index{angle measure!hyperbolic angle measure}\index{hyperbolic angle measure}\emph{hyperbolic angle measure} (or \index{h-angle measure}\emph{h-angle measure}) 
$\measuredangle_h PQR$ is defined as
$\measuredangle XQY$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:h-perp-unique}
Let $\ell$ be an h-line and $P$ be an h-point which does not lie on $\ell$.
Show that there is unique h-line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $\ell$.
\end{thm}

\section*{The plan}
\addtocontents{toc}{The plan.}

We defined all the {}\emph{h-notions} needed in the formulation of the axioms \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0}--\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:3} and h-\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4}.
It remains to show that all these axioms hold; 
this will be done by the end of this chapter.

Once we are done with the proofs, 
we get that the model provides an example of absolute plane; in particular Exercise~\ref{ex:h-perp-unique} can be proved the same way as Theorem~\ref{perp:ex+un}.

Most importantly we will prove the ``if''-part of Theorem~\ref{thm:consistent}.

Indeed, any statement in hyperbolic geometry can be restated in the Euclidean plane using the introduced h-notions.
Therefore if the system of axioms \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0}--\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:3} and h-\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4} leads to a contradiction the so does  the system  axioms \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0}--\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4}.

\section*{Auxiliary statements}
\addtocontents{toc}{Auxiliary statements.}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:P-->O} 
Consider h-plane with unit circle as the absolute.
Let $O$ be the center of absolute and $P$ be an other h-point.
Denote by $P'$ the inversion of $P$ in the absolute.

Then the circle $\Gamma$ with center $P'$ and radius 
$1/\sqrt{1-OP^2}$
is perpendicular to the absolute.
Moreover $O$ is the inversion of $P$ in $\Gamma$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{o}{43mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-8mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/PO-Gamma(1)}

\lbl[b]{33,14;$P$}
\lbl[b]{40,14;$P'$}
\lbl[b]{33,30;$T$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.} 
Follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:centers-of-perp-circles}.
\qeds

Assume $\Gamma$ is a circline which is perpendicular to the absolute.
Consider the inversion $X\mapsto X'$
in $\Gamma$, 
or if $\Gamma$ is a line,
set $X\mapsto X'$ to be the reflection in $\Gamma$.

The following observation roughly says that the map $X\mapsto X'$ respects all the notions introduced in the previous section.
Together with the lemma above, it implies that in any problem which formulated entirely {}\emph{in h-terms}  we can assume that a given h-point lies in the center of absolute.

\begin{thm}{Main observation}\label{thm:main-observ}
The map $X\mapsto X'$ described above is a bijection of h-plane to itself. 
Moreover for any h-points $P$, $Q$, $R$ such that $P\ne Q$ and $Q\ne R$ the following conditions hold
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{h-line-to-hline} The h-lines $(PQ)_h$, $[PQ)_h$ and $[PQ]_h$ are mapped to the h-lines $(P'Q')_h$, $[P'Q')_h$ and $[P'Q']_h$ correspondingly.
\item\label{h-reflect} $\delta(P',Q')=\delta(P,Q)$ and $P'Q'_h=PQ_h$.
\item\label{h-angle-mes} 
$\measuredangle_h P'Q'R'\equiv-\measuredangle_h PQR$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
According to Theorem~\ref{thm:perp-inverse} the map sends the absolute to itself. 
Note that the points on $\Gamma$ do not move, it follows that points inside of absolute remain inside after the mapping and the other way around. 


Part~(\ref{h-line-to-hline}) follows from \ref{thm:inverse-cline} and \ref{thm:angle-inversion}.

Part~(\ref{h-reflect}) follows from Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}.

Part~(\ref{h-angle-mes})  follows from Theorem~\ref{thm:angle-inversion}.
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:h-reflection}
Let $\Gamma$ be a circle which is perpendicular to the absolute and $Q$ be an h-point lying on $\Gamma$.
Assume $P$ is an h-point and $P'$ is its inversion in  $\Gamma$.
Show that $PQ_h=P'Q_h$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:def-delta}
Consider the function
\[\theta(P,Q)=2\cdot\frac{PQ\cdot  P'Q'}{PP'\cdot QQ'},\]
where $P, Q$ are points in the h-plane
and $P', Q'$ are their inversions in the absolute.
Show that 
\[2+2\cdot\theta(P,Q)
=
\delta(P,Q)+\frac{1}{\delta(P,Q)}.\]
Conclude that
\[PQ_h=\ln\left[1+\theta(P,Q)+\sqrt{\theta(P,Q)^2+2\cdot\theta(P,Q)}\right].\]

\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:O-h-dist}
Assume that the absolute is a unit circle centered at $O$.
Given a h-point $P$, set $x=OP$ and $y=OP_h$.
Then
\begin{align*}
y&=\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}
&
&\text{and}
&
x&=\frac{e^y-1}{e^y+1}.
\end{align*}
 
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{o}{41mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(-4mm)]{pics/AOPB(1)}

\lbl[t]{22,20;$O$}
\lbl[t]{30,20;$P$}
\lbl[tl]{42,20;$B$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Note that h-line $(OP)_h$ lies in a diameter of absolute.
Therefore if $A$ and $B$ are the ideal points as in the definition of h-distance.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
OA&=OB=1,
\\ PA&=1+x,\\
PB&=1-x.
\intertext{and}
y&=\ln \frac{AP\cdot BO}{PB\cdot OA}=
\\
&=\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}.
\end{align*}

Taking exponent of left and right hand side and applying obvious algebra manipulations we get
$$x=\frac{e^y-1}{e^y+1}.$$
\qedsf


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:h-tiangle=}
Assume points $P$, $Q$ and $R$ appear on one h-line in the same order.
Then 
$$PQ_h+QR_h=PR_h.$$ 

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Note that
$$PQ_h+QR_h=PR_h$$
is equivalent to 
\[\delta(P,Q)\cdot\delta(Q,R)=\delta(P,R).\eqlbl{eq:deltaPQR}\]

Let $A$ and $B$ be the ideal points of $(PQ)_h$. 
Without loss of generality we can assume that the points $A,P,Q,R,B$ appear in the same order on the circline containing $(PQ)_h$.
Then
\begin{align*}
\delta(P,Q)\cdot\delta(Q,R)
&=
\frac{AQ\cdot BP}{QB\cdot PA}\cdot\frac{AR\cdot BQ}{RB\cdot QA}=
\\
&=\frac{AR\cdot BP}{RB\cdot PA}=
\\
&=\delta(P,R)
\end{align*}
Hence \ref{eq:deltaPQR} follows.
\qeds

Let $P$ be an h-point and $\rho>0$.
The set of all h-points $Q$ such that $PQ_h=\rho$ is called \index{h-circle}\emph{h-circle} with center $P$ and \index{h-radius}\emph{h-radius} $\rho$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:h-circle=circle}
Any h-circle  is formed by a Euclidean circle which lies completely in h-plane.

More precisely for any h-point $P$ and $\rho\ge 0$
there is a $\hat\rho\ge 0$ and a point $\hat P$ such that 
$$PQ_h= \rho
\ \ \iff\ \ 
\hat PQ= \hat\rho.$$

Moreover, if $O$ is the center of absolute then 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\hat O=O$ for any $\rho$ and
\item $\hat P\in (OP)$ for any $P\ne O$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist}, 
$OQ_h= \rho$ if and only if $$OQ= \hat\rho=\frac{e^\rho-1}{e^\rho+1}.$$
Therefore the locus of h-points $Q$ such that $OQ_h= \rho$ is formed by the Euclidean circle, 
denote it by $\Delta_\rho$.

\lbl[b]{33,23.5;$\hat P$}
\lbl[br]{31,29;$\Delta'_\rho$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}


If $P\ne O$, applying Lemma~\ref{lem:P-->O} and the Main observation (\ref{thm:main-observ})
we get
a circle $\Gamma$ perpendicular to the absolute such that $P$ is the inversion of $O$ in $\Gamma$.

Let $\Delta_\rho'$ be the inversion of $\Delta_\rho$ in $\Gamma$.
Since the inversion in $\Gamma$ preserves the h-distance,
$PQ_h=\rho$ if and only if $Q\z\in\Delta_\rho'$.
  
According to Theorem~\ref{thm:inverse-cline}, 
$\Delta_\rho'$ is a Euclidean circle.
Denote by $\hat P$ the Euclidean center and by $\hat\rho$ the Euclidean radius of $\Delta_\rho'$.

Finally note that $\Delta_\rho'$ reflects to itself in $(OP)$;
that is, the center $\hat P$ lies on $(OP)$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:h-circle=circle}
Assume $P$, $\hat P$ and $O$ be as in the Lemma~\ref{lem:h-circle=circle} and $P\ne O$.
Show that  $\hat P\in [OP]$.

\section*{Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0}}
\addtocontents{toc}{Axioms: \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0},}

Evidently h-plane contains at least two points.
Therefore to show that Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:0} holds in h-plane we need to show that h-distance defined on page \pageref{h-dist} is a metric on h-plane;
i.e., the each condition (\ref{def:metric-space:a})--(\ref{def:metric-space:d}) 
in Definition~\ref{def:metric-space} hold for h-distance.


The following claim says that 
h-distance meets 
the conditions (\ref{def:metric-space:a}) 
and (\ref{def:metric-space:b}).

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Given h-points $P$ and $Q$, 
we have
$PQ_h\ge 0$
and $PQ_h=0$ 
if and only if $P=Q$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:P-->O}
and Main Observation (\ref{thm:main-observ}), 
we may assume that $Q$ is the center of absolute.
In this case
$$
\delta(Q,P)=\frac{1+QP}{1-QP}\ge 1$$
and the equality holds only if $P=Q$.

Therefore
$$QP_h=\ln[\delta(Q,P)]\ge 0.$$
and the equality holds if and only if $P=Q$.
\qeds

By the following claim says that 
h-distance meets 
the conditions \ref{def:metric-space}(\ref{def:metric-space:c}).

\begin{thm}{Claim}
For any h-points $P$ and $Q$, we have
$PQ_h=QP_h$.
\end{thm}

\lbl[tl]{21,11;$A$}
\lbl[bl]{21,35.5;$B$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $A$ and $B$ be ideal points of $(PQ)_h$ and
$A,P,Q,B$ appear on the circline containing $(PQ)_h$ in the same order.

Then
\begin{align*}
PQ_h
&=\ln\frac{AQ\cdot BP}{QB\cdot PA}
=
\\
&=\ln\frac{BP\cdot AQ}{PA\cdot QB}=
\\
&=QP_h.

The following claim shows in particular that
triangle inequality 
(which is condition \ref{def:metric-space}(\ref{def:metric-space:d}))
holds  for $h$-distance.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:h-dist+trig-inq}
Given a triple of h-points $P$, $Q$ and $R$,
we have
\[PQ_h+QR_h\ge PR_h.\]
Moreover, the equality holds if and only if $P$, $Q$ and $R$ lie on one h-line in the same order.

\lbl[tr]{12.5,14;$Q$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, 
we may assume that $RP_h\z\ge PQ_h>0$
and $R$ is the center of absolute.

Denote by $\Delta$ 
the h-circle with center $P$ 
and h-radius $PQ_h$.
Let $S$ and $T$ be the points of intersection of $(RP)$ and $\Delta$.

Since $PQ_h\le RP_h$,
by Lemma~\ref{lem:h-tiangle=}
we can assume that the points $R$, $S$, $P$ and $T$ appear on the h-line in the same order.

Set $\rho=PQ_h$.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:h-circle=circle},
$\Delta$ is a Euclidean circle;
denote by $\hat P$ its Euclidean center.
Note that $\hat P$ is the (Euclidean) midpoint of $[ST]$.

By the Euclidean triangle inequality 
$$RT=R\hat P+\hat PQ\ge RQ\eqlbl{RT>RQ}$$
and the equality holds if and only if $T=Q$. 

By Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist},
\begin{align*}
RT_h&=\ln\frac{1+RT}{1-RT}\\
RQ_h&=\ln\frac{1+RQ}{1-RQ}.
\end{align*}
Since the function $f(x)=\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ is increasing for $x\in[0,1)$, 
inequality \ref{RT>RQ} implies
$$RT_h\ge RQ_h$$
and the equality holds if and only if only if $T=Q$.

Finally applying Lemma~\ref{lem:h-tiangle=} again, we get $$RT_h=RP_h+PQ_h.$$
Hence the claim follows.

\section*{Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:1}}
\addtocontents{toc}{\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:1},}

Note that once the following claim is proved,
Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:1} 
follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:h-line}.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
A subset of h-plane is an h-line if and only if it forms a line for h-distance in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:line}.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\ell$ be an h-line.
Applying the main observation we can assume that $\ell$ contains the center of absolute.
In this case $\ell$ is formed by intersection of diameter of absolute and the h-plane.
Let $A$ and $B$ be the endpoints of the diameter.

Consider the map $\iota\:\ell\to \mathbb{R}$ defined as
$$\iota(X)=\ln \frac{AX}{XB}.$$
Note that $\iota\:\ell\to \mathbb{R}$ is a bijection.

Further, if $X,Y\in \ell$ and the points $A$, $X$, $Y$ and $B$ appear on $[AB]$ in the same order then
\[\iota(Y)-\iota(X)=\ln \frac{AY}{YB}-\ln \frac{AX}{XB}=\ln \frac{AY\cdot BX}{YB\cdot XB}=XY_h;\]
that is, any h-line is a line for h-metric.

We proved that any h-line is a line for h-distance.
The converse follows from Claim~\ref{clm:h-dist+trig-inq}.

\section*{Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2}}
\addtocontents{toc}{\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2},}

Note that the first part of Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2} follows directly from the definition of h-angle measure defined on page~\pageref{h-angle measure}.
It remains to show that $\measuredangle_h$ satisfies the conditions \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2a}, \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2b} and \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2c} on page \pageref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2b}.

The following two claims say that
$\measuredangle_h$ satisfies
 \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2a} and \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2b}.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:h2a}
Given an h-half-line $[O P)$ and $\alpha\in(-\pi,\pi]$ there is unique  h-half-line $[O Q)$ such that $\measuredangle P O Q= \alpha$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:h2b}
For any h-points $P$, $Q$ and $R$ distinct from h-point $O$ we have
$$\measuredangle P O Q+\measuredangle Q O R\equiv \measuredangle P O R.$$

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of \ref{clm:h2a} and \ref{clm:h2b}.}
Applying the main observation, 
we may assume that $O$ is the center of absolute.
In this case, for any h-point $P\ne O$,
$[OP)_h$ is the intersection of $[OP)$ with h-plane.
Hence the claims \ref{clm:h2a} and \ref{clm:h2b} 
follow from the corresponding axioms of Euclidean plane.
\qeds

The following claim says that
$\measuredangle_h$ satisfies
 \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2c}.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:h2c}
The function 
$$\measuredangle_h\:(P,Q,R)\mapsto\measuredangle P Q R$$
is continuous at any triple of points $(P,Q,R)$
such that $Q\ne P$ and $Q\ne R$ and $\measuredangle_h P Q R\ne\pi$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $O$ the center of absolute.
We can assume that $Q$ is distinct from $O$.

Denote by $Z$ the inversion of $Q$ in the absolute
and by $\Gamma$ the circle perpendicular to the absolute which is centered at $Q'$.
According to Lemma~\ref{lem:P-->O},
the point $O$ is the inversion of $Q$ in $\Gamma$.

Denote by $P'$ and $R'$ the inversions in $\Gamma$ of the points $P$ and $R$ correspondingly.
Note that the point $P'$ is completely determined by the points $Q$ and $P$;
moreover the map $(Q,P)\mapsto P'$ is continuous at any pair of points $(Q,P)$ such that $Q\ne O$.
The same is true for the map $(Q,R)\mapsto R'$

According to the Main Observation 
$$\measuredangle_h P Q R\equiv -\measuredangle_h P' O R'.$$
Since $\measuredangle_h P' O R'=\measuredangle P' O R'$ and 
the maps $(Q,P)\mapsto P'$, $(Q,R)\mapsto R'$ are continuous,
the claim follows from the corresponding axiom of Euclidean plane.

\section*{Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:3}}
\addtocontents{toc}{\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:3},}

The following claim says that Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:3} holds holds in the h-plane.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
In the h-plane, we have
$\triangle_h P Q R 
\cong
\triangle_h P' Q' R'$
if and only if 
\begin{align*}
Q' P'_h&=Q P_h, & Q' R'_h&= Q R_h, &&\text{and}
&\measuredangle_h P' Q' R'&=\pm\measuredangle P Q R.
\end{align*}
 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Applying the main observation, 
we can assume that both $Q$ and $Q'$ coincide with the center of absolute.
In this case 
$$\measuredangle P' Q R'=\measuredangle_h P' Q R'=\pm\measuredangle_h P Q R=\pm\measuredangle P Q R.$$
Since 
$$Q P_h=Q P'_h\ \ \text{and}\ \ Q R_h=Q R'_h,$$
Lemma \ref{lem:O-h-dist} implies that the same holds for the Euclidean distances;
that is,
$$Q P=Q P'\ \ \text{and}\ \ Q R=Q R'.$$
By SAS,
there is a motion of Euclidean plane which sends $Q$ to itself, $P$ to $P'$ and $R$ to $R'$

Note that the center of absolute is fixed by the corresponding motion.
It follows that this motion gives also a motion of h-plane;
in particular the h-triangles  
$\triangle_h P Q R$ and $\triangle_h P' Q R'$ are h-congruent.

Finally we need to check that the Axiom~h-$\!$\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4} on page \pageref{def:hyperbolic-4a} holds;
i.e., we need to prove the following claim.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
For any h-line $\ell$ and any h-point $P\notin\ell$ there are at least two h-lines which pass through $P$ and have no points of intersection with $\ell$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Instead o proof.}
Applying the main observation we can assume that $P$ is the center of absolute.

The remaining part of proof can be guessed from the picture

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:3-h-lines}
Show that in the h-plane 
there are 3 mutually parallel h-lines 
such that any pair of these three lines lies on one side from the remaining h-line.
