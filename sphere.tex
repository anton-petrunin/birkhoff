\chapter{Spherical geometry}
\label{chap:sphere}

Spherical geometry studies the surface of a unit sphere.
This geometry has applications in cartography, navigation, and astronomy.

The spherical geometry is a close relative of the Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries.
Most of the theorems in hyperbolic geometry have spherical analogs,
but spherical geometry is easier to visualize. 

\section{Euclidean space}

Recall that Euclidean space is the set $\mathbb{R}^3$ of all triples $(x,y,z)$ of real numbers
such that the distance between a pair of points
$A\z=(x_A,y_A,z_A)$ and $B=(x_B,y_B,z_B)$
is defined by the following formula:
$$AB
\df
\sqrt{(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2+(z_A-z_B)^2}.$$

The planes in this space are defined as the set of solutions of 
$$a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c\cdot z+d=0$$ 
for constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, where at least one of the numbers $a$, $b$, or $c$ is not zero.
Any such plane is isometric to the Euclidean plane.

A sphere in space is the direct analog of a circle in the plane.
Formally, a \index{sphere}\emph{sphere} with center $O$ and radius $r$ is the set of points in the space that lie at the distance $r$ from~$O$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be two points on the unit sphere centered at~$O$.
The \index{distance!spherical}\index{spherical distance}\emph{spherical distance} from $A$ to $B$
(briefly $AB_s$)
 is defined as  $|\measuredangle AOB|$. 

In spherical geometry, the role of lines play the \index{great circle}\emph{great circles};
that is, the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing thru~$O$.

Note that the great circles do not form lines in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:line}.
Also, any two distinct great circles intersect at two antipodal points.
In particular, the sphere does not satisfy the axioms of the neutral plane.

\section{Pythagorean theorem}

Here is an analog of the Pythagorean theorems (\ref{thm:pyth} and \ref{thm:pyth-h-poincare}) in spherical geometry.

\begin{thm}{Spherical Pythagorean theorem}\label{thm:s-pyth}
Let $\triangle_sABC$ be a spherical triangle with a right angle at~$C$.
Set $a=BC_s$, $b=CA_s$, and $c=AB_s$.
Then
$$\cos c=\cos a\cdot\cos b.$$

\end{thm}

In the proof, we will use the notion of the scalar product which we are about to discuss.

Let $v_A\z=(x_A,y_A,z_A)$ and $v_B=(x_B,y_B,z_B)$ denote the position vectors of points $A$ and $B$.
The \index{scalar product}\emph{scalar product} of the two vectors $v_A$ and $v_B$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$
is defined as 
$$\langle v_A,v_B\rangle
\df
x_A\cdot x_B+y_A\cdot y_B+z_A\cdot z_B.\eqlbl{eq:scal-def}$$

Assume both vectors $v_A$ and $v_B$ are nonzero;
suppose that $\phi$ denotes the angle measure between them.
Then the scalar product can be expressed the following way:
$$\langle v_A,v_B\rangle=|v_A|\cdot|v_B|\cdot\cos\phi,
\eqlbl{eq:scal-angle}$$
where 
\begin{align*}
|v_A|&=\sqrt{x_A^2+y_A^2+z_A^2},
&
|v_B|&=\sqrt{x_B^2+y_B^2+z_B^2}.
\end{align*}

Now, assume that the points $A$ and $B$ 
lie on the unit sphere $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ centered at the origin.
In this case, $|v_A|=|v_B|=1$.
By \ref{eq:scal-angle} we get that
$$\cos AB_s=\langle v_A,v_B\rangle.
\eqlbl{eq:scalar-s-dist}$$

\parit{Proof of the spherical Pythagorean theorem.}
Since the angle at $C$ is right,
we can choose the coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^3$ so that 
$v_C\z=(0,0,1)$, $v_A$ lies in the $(x,y)$-plane, so $v_A\z=(x_A,0,z_A)$,
and $v_B$ lies in the $(y,z)$-plane, so $v_B=(0,y_B,z_B)$.

Applying, \ref{eq:scalar-s-dist},
we get that
\begin{align*}
z_A&=\langle v_C,v_A\rangle
=\cos b,
\\
z_B&=\langle v_C,v_B\rangle
=\cos a.
\end{align*}

Applying, \ref{eq:scal-def} and \ref{eq:scalar-s-dist}, we get that
\begin{align*}
\cos c &=\langle v_A,v_B\rangle=
\\
&=x_A\cdot 0+0\cdot y_B+z_A\cdot z_B=
\\
&=\cos b\cdot\cos a.
\end{align*}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:2(pi/4)=pi/3}
Show that 
if $\triangle_sABC$ is a spherical triangle with a right angle at $C$,
and $AC_s=BC_s=\tfrac\pi4$, then $AB_s=\tfrac\pi3$.
\end{thm}

\section{Imaginary distance}

Recall that  
\[
\cosh x=\frac {e^{x}+e^{-x}}2
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\cos x=\frac {e^{i\cdot x}+e^{-i\cdot x}}2.
\]
The first formula is the definition of the hyperbolic cosine;
the second one is called Euler's formula (see \ref{sec:Euler's formula}).
It follows that 
\[\cosh x=\cos (i\cdot x)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\cos x=\cosh (i\cdot x).\]

Look at the formulas in hyperbolic and spherical Pythagorean theorems (see \ref{thm:s-pyth} and \ref{thm:pyth-h-poincare}):
\begin{align*}
\cosh c&=\cosh a\cdot \cosh b,
&
\cos c&=\cos a\cdot \cos b.
\end{align*}
Note that if we change $a$, $b$, and $c$ to $i\cdot a$, $i\cdot b$, and $i\cdot c$,
then the first formula transforms to the second one, and the other way around.

The same holds for all analytic formulas in spherical and hyperbolic geometry.
This remarkable discovery was made by Franz Taurinus \cite{taurinus}; we are not going to prove it.

\section[Inversion]{Inversion across a sphere}

The inversion across a sphere is defined the same way as the inversion across a circle.

Formally, let $\Sigma$ be the sphere with center $O$ and radius~$r$.
The \index{inversion!inversion across a sphere}\emph{inversion} across $\Sigma$ of a point $P$ is the point $P'\in[OP)$ such that
$$OP\cdot OP'=r^2.$$
In this case, the sphere $\Sigma$  will be called the 
\index{inversion!sphere of inversion}\emph{sphere of inversion},
and its center is called the \index{inversion!center of inversion}\emph{center of inversion}.

We also add $\infty$ to the space and assume that the center of inversion is mapped to $\infty$ and the other way around. 
The space $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the point $\infty$ will be called \index{inversive!space}\emph{inversive space}.

The inversion of space shares many properties with the inversion of the plane.
Most importantly, analogs of theorems \ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}, \ref{thm:inverse-cline}, \ref{thm:angle-inversion} can be summarized as follows:

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:inversion-3d}
The inversion across the sphere has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{thm:inversion-3d:a} Inversion maps a sphere or a plane into a sphere or a plane.
\item\label{thm:inversion-3d:b} Inversion maps a circle or a line into a circle or a line. 
\item\label{thm:inversion-3d:cross-ratio} Inversion preserves the cross-ratio;
that is, if $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, and $D'$ are the inverses of the points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ respectively,
then
$$\frac{AB\cdot CD}{BC\cdot DA}= \frac{A'B'\cdot C'D'}{B'C'\cdot D'A'}.$$
\item Inversion maps arcs into arcs.
\item\label{thm:inversion-3d:angle} Inversion preserves the absolute value of the angle
measure between tangent half-lines to the arcs.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


We do not present the proofs here, but they closely resemble the corresponding proofs in plane geometry.
To prove \textit{(\ref{thm:inversion-3d:a})}, you additionally need the following lemma;
its proof is left to the reader.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $\Sigma$ be a subset of the Euclidean space
that contains at least two points.
Fix a point $O$ in the space.

Then $\Sigma$ is 
a sphere 
if and only if
for any plane $\Pi$ passing thru $O$,
the intersection $\Pi\cap \Sigma$ is either an empty set,
a one-point set, or a circle.
\end{thm}  

The following observation reduces part~\textit{(\ref{thm:inversion-3d:b})} to part~\textit{(\ref{thm:inversion-3d:a})}.

\begin{thm}{Observation}
Any circle in the space is an intersection of two spheres.
\end{thm}

Now, let us define a \index{circular cone}\emph{circular cone} as a set formed by line segments from a fixed point, called the \index{tip of cone}\emph{tip} of the cone, to all the points on a fixed circle, called the \index{base!of cone}\emph{base} of the cone;
we always assume that the base does not lie in the same plane as the tip.
We say that the cone is \index{right circular cone}\emph{right} 
if the center of the base circle is the footpoint of the tip on the base plane;
otherwise, we call it \index{oblique circular cone}\emph{oblique}.

}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:cone}
Let $K$ be an oblique circular cone. Show that there is a plane $\Pi$ that is not parallel to the base plane of $K$ such that the intersection $\Pi\cap K$ is a circle.
\end{thm}


\section{Stereographic projection}

{

\caption*{The plane thru $P$, $O$, and~$S$.}
\end{wrapfigure}

Consider the unit sphere $\Sigma$ 
centered at the origin $(0,0,0)$.
This sphere can be described by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2\z=1$. 

Suppose that $\Pi$ denotes the $(x,y)$-plane;
it is defined by the equation $z = 0$.
Clearly, $\Pi$
runs thru the center of~$\Sigma$.

Let $N = (0, 0, 1)$ and $S\z=(0, 0, -1)$ denote the ``north'' and ``south'' poles of $\Sigma$;
these are the points on the sphere that have extremal distances to~$\Pi$.
Suppose that $\Omega$ denotes the ``equator'' of $\Sigma$;
it is the intersection $\Sigma\cap\Pi$.

}

For any point $P\ne S$ on $\Sigma$,
consider the line $(SP)$ in the space. 
This line intersects $\Pi$ at exactly one point, denoted by~$P'$. 
Set $S'=\infty$.


The map $\xi_s\: P\mapsto P'$ is called the \index{stereographic projection}\emph{stereographic projection from $\Sigma$ to $\Pi$ with respect to the south pole}.
The inverse of this map $\xi^{-1}_s\: P'\z\mapsto P$ is called the {}\emph{stereographic projection from $\Pi$ to $\Sigma$ with respect to the south pole}.

In the same way, one can define the
{}\emph{stereographic projections $\xi_n$ and $\xi^{-1}_n$ with respect to the north pole}~$N$.

Note that $P=P'$ if and only if $P\in\Omega$.


Note that if $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ are as above,
then the composition of the stereographic projections 
$\xi_s: \Sigma\to\Pi$ and  $\xi^{-1}_s: \Pi\to\Sigma$
are the restrictions to $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ respectively of the inversion across the sphere $\Upsilon$ with the center $S$ and radius $\sqrt{2}$.


From the above and Theorem~\ref{thm:inversion-3d},
it follows that the stereographic projection preserves 
the angles between arcs;
more precisely, \textit{the absolute value of the angle measure} between arcs on the sphere.

This makes it particularly useful in cartography.
A map of a large region of the earth cannot be done on a constant scale,
but by using a stereographic projection, one can keep the angles between roads the same as on the earth.

In the following exercises,
we assume that $\Sigma$, $\Pi$, $\Upsilon$, $\Omega$, $O$, $S$, and $N$ are as described above.
  
\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:two-stereographics}
Show that $\xi_n \circ \xi^{-1}_s$, the composition of stereographic projections 
from $\Pi$ to $\Sigma$ from  $S$, and
from $\Sigma$ to $\Pi$ from  $N$ is 
the inverse of the plane $\Pi$ across~$\Omega$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:great-circ}
Show that  a stereographic projection $\Sigma\to\Pi$
sends the great circles to plane circlines that intersect $\Omega$ at opposite points.
\end{thm}

The following exercise is analogous to Lemma~\ref{lem:conformal}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:conform-sphere}
Fix a point $P\in \Pi$  and let $Q$ be another point in~$\Pi$.
Let $P'$ and $Q'$ denote their stereographic projections to~$\Sigma$.
Set $x=PQ$ and $y=P'Q'_s$.
Show that
$$\lim_{x\to 0}\, \frac{y}{x}=\frac{2}{1+OP^2}.$$
\end{thm}



\section{Central projection}

Central projection is analogous to the projective model of the hyperbolic plane which is discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:klein}.

Let $\Sigma$ be the unit sphere centered at the origin~$O$.
Suppose that $\Pi^+$ denotes the plane defined by the equation $z=1$.
This plane is parallel to the $(x,y)$-plane and passes thru 
the north pole $N\z=(0,0,1)$ of~$\Sigma$.

Recall that the northern hemisphere of $\Sigma$
is the subset of points $(x,y,z)\z\in \Sigma$ such that $z>0$.
The northern  hemisphere will be denoted by~$\Sigma^+$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{40mm}
\centering
\vskip-0mm
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-254}
\end{wrapfigure}

Given a point $P\in \Sigma^+$, consider the half-line $[OP)$. 
Suppose that $P'$ denotes the intersection of $[OP)$ and~$\Pi^+$.
Note that 
if $P=(x,y,z)$, then $P'=(\tfrac xz,\tfrac yz,1)$.
It follows that $P\leftrightarrow P'$ is a bijection between $\Sigma^+$ and~$\Pi^+$.



The described bijection $\Sigma^+\leftrightarrow \Pi^+$ is called the \index{central projection}\emph{central projection} of 
the hemisphere~$\Sigma^+$.

Note that the central projection sends the intersections of the great circles with $\Sigma^+$ to the lines in~$\Pi^+$.
This follows since the great circles are intersections of $\Sigma$ with planes passing thru the origin,
and the lines in $\Pi^+$ are the intersection of $\Pi^+$ with these planes.

The following exercise 
is analogous to Exercise~\ref{ex:h-median}
in hyperbolic geometry.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:s-medians}
Let $\triangle_sABC$ be a nondegenerate spherical triangle.
Assume that the plane $\Pi^+$ is parallel to the plane passing thru $A$, $B$, and~$C$.
Let $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ denote the central projections of $A$, $B$, and~$C$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{ex:s-medians:a} Show that the midpoints of $[A'B']$, $[B'C']$, and $[C'A']$
are central projections of the midpoints of $[AB]_s$, $[BC]_s$, and $[CA]_s$ respectively.
\item\label{ex:s-medians:b} Use part (\ref{ex:s-medians:a}) to show that the medians of a spherical triangle intersect at one point.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}
