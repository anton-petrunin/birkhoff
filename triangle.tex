Triangle geometry studies of the properties of triangles, including associated centers and circles.

In this chapter we discuss the most basic results in triangle geometry, 
mostly to show that we have developed enough machinery to prove things.

\section*{Circumcircle and circumcenter}
\addtocontents{toc}{Circumcircle and circumcenter.}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:circumcenter}
Perpendicular bisectors to the sides of any nondegenerate triangle  in the Euclidean plane intersect at one point.
\end{thm}

The point of the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors is called circumcenter.
It is the center of the circumcircle of the triangle;
that is, the circle which pass thru all three vertices of the triangle.
The circumcenter of the triangle is usually denoted by $O$.

\lbl[b]{3,19,-30;$\ell$}
\lbl[b]{22,18,17;$m$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}


\parit{Proof.}
Let $\triangle ABC$ be nondegenerate.
Let $\ell$ and $m$ be perpendicular bisectors to sides $[AB]$ and $[AC]$ correspondingly.

Assume $\ell$ and $m$ intersect,
let $O=\ell\cap m$.

Let us Theorem \ref{thm:perp-bisect}.
Since $O\in\ell$, we have $OA=OB$ and since $O\in m$, we have $OA=OC$.
It follows that $OB\z=OC$;
that is, $O$ lies on the perpendicular bisector to $[B C]$.

It remains to show that $\ell\nparallel m$;
assume contrary.
Since
$\ell\perp(AB)$ and $m\perp (AC)$, we get $(AC)\z\parallel (AB)$ 
(see Exercise~\ref{ex:perp-perp}).
Therefore by Theorem \ref{perp:ex+un}, $(AC)=(AB)$;
that is, $\triangle ABC$ is degenerate, a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:unique-cline}
There is unique circle which pass thru vertices of a given nondegenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane. 
\end{thm}




\section*{Altitudes and orthocenter}
\addtocontents{toc}{Altitudes and orthocenter.}

An \index{altitude}\emph{altitude} of a triangle is a line thru a vertex and perpendicular to the line containing the opposite side.
The term \index{altitude}\emph{altitude} maybe also used for the distance from the vertex to its foot point on the line containing opposite side.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:orthocenter}
The three altitudes of any nondegenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane intersect in a single point.
\end{thm}

The point of intersection of altitudes is called \index{orthocenter}\emph{orthocenter}; 
it is usually denoted as $H$.

\lbl[tr]{4,12;$A$}
\lbl[lb]{23,24;$A'$}
\lbl[tl]{17,12;$B$}
\lbl[b]{12,24;$C$}
\lbl[t]{9,0;$C'$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\triangle A B C$ be nondegenerate.

Consider three lines $\ell\parallel(BC)$ thru $A$,
$m\z\parallel(CA)$ thru $B$ and
$n\parallel(AB)$ thru $C$.
Since $\triangle A B C$ is nondegenerate,
no pair of the lines $\ell$, $m$ and $n$ is parallel.
Set $A'=m\cap n$, $B'=n\cap \ell$ and $C'=\ell\cap m$.

Note that $\square A B A' C$, $\square B C B' A$ and $\square C B C' A$ are parallelograms.
Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:parallelogram} we get that $\triangle ABC$ is the median triangle of $\triangle A' B' C'$;
that is, $A$, $B$ and $C$ are the midpoints of $[B' C']$, $[C' A']$ and $[A' B']$ correspondingly.

By Exercise \ref{ex:perp-perp},
$(B' C')\parallel (BC)$,
the altitudes from $A$ is perpendicular to $[B' C']$ 
and from above it bisects $[B' C']$.

Whence the altitudes of $\triangle A B C$ 
are also perpendicular bisectors of the triangle $\triangle A' B' C'$.
Applying Theorem~\ref{thm:circumcenter}, we get that altitudes of $\triangle ABC$ intersect at one point.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:orthic-4}
Assume $H$ is the orthocenter of an acute triangle $\triangle A B C$ in the Euclidean plane.
Show that $A$ is orthocenter of  
$\triangle H B C$.
\end{thm}


\section*{Medians and centroid}
\addtocontents{toc}{Medians and centroid.}

A median of a triangle is a segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposing side. 

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:centroid}
The three medians of any nondegenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane intersect in a single point.
Moreover the point of intersection divides each median in ratio 2:1.
\end{thm}

The point of intersection of medians is called
\index{centroid}\emph{centroid}; 
it is usually denoted by $M$.

\parit{Proof.}
Consider a nondegenerate triangle $\triangle A B C$.
Let $[A A']$ and $[B B']$ be its medians.

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:chevinas}, 
$[A A']$ and $[B B']$ are intersecting. 
Let us denote by $M$ the point of intersection.

By SAS, $\triangle B' A' C\z\sim \triangle A B C$ and $A' B'=\tfrac12\cdot A B$.
In particular 
$\measuredangle A B C= \measuredangle B' A' C$.

Since $A'$ lies between $B$ and $C$,
we get $\measuredangle BA'B'+\measuredangle B'A'C=\pi$.
Therefore 
$$\measuredangle B'A'B+\measuredangle A'BA=\pi.$$
By Transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}), 
$(A B)\z\parallel (A' B')$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{28mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(1mm)]{pics/medians(1)}
\lbl[tr]{1,1;$A$}
\lbl[l]{15,23;$A'$}
\lbl[t]{24,1;$B$}
\lbl[r]{3,23;$B'$}
\lbl[b]{6,45;$C$}
\lbl[t]{10,13;$M$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that $A'$ and $A$ lie on the opposite sides from $(BB')$.
Therefore by Transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2})
we get 
$$\measuredangle B'A'M=\measuredangle BAM.$$
The same way we get,
$$\measuredangle A'B'M=\measuredangle ABM.$$
By AA condition,
$\triangle A B M\sim\triangle A' B' M$.

Since $A' B'=\tfrac12\cdot A B$, 
we have
$$\frac{A' M}{A M}=\frac{B' M}{B M}=\frac12.$$
In particular $M$ divides medians $[A A']$ and $[B B']$ in ratio 2:1.

Note that $M$ is unique point on $[B B']$ 
such that $$\frac{B' M}{B M}=\frac12.$$
Repeating the same argument for vertices $B$ and $C$ we get that all medians
$[C C']$ and $[B B']$ intersect in $M$.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:midle}
Let $\square ABCD$ be a nondegenerate quadrilateral
and $X$, $Y$, $V$, $W$ be the midpoints of its sides 
$[AB]$, $[BC]$, $[CD]$ and $[DA]$.
Show that $\square XYVW$ is a parallelogram.
\end{thm}



\section*{Bisector of triangle}
\addtocontents{toc}{Bisector of triangle.}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:bisect-ratio}
Let $\triangle A B C$ be  a nondegenerate triangle in the Euclidean plane.
Assume that the bisector of $\angle BAC$ 
intersects $[BC]$ at the point $D$.
Then 
$$\frac{AB}{AC}=\frac{DB}{DC}.
\eqlbl{bisect-ratio}$$

\end{thm}

\lbl[tl]{14,21.5;$D$}
\lbl[r]{10,7;$E$}
\lbl[l]{16,3;$\ell$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\ell$ be the line thru $C$ parallel to $(AB)$.
Note that $\ell\nparallel (AD)$;
set $E=\ell\cap (AD)$.

Note that $B$ and $C$ lie on the opposite sides of $(AD)$.
Therefore by Transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}),
$$\measuredangle BAD=\measuredangle CED.\eqlbl{eq:<BAD=<CED}$$

Further, note that the angles $\angle ADB$ and $\angle EDC$ are vertical; in particular, by \ref{prop:vert} 
$$\measuredangle ADB=\measuredangle EDC.$$

By AA similarity condition, 
$\triangle ABD\sim \triangle ECD$.
In particular, 
$$\frac{AB}{EC}=\frac{DB}{DC}.\eqlbl{eq:AB/EC=DB/DC}$$

Since $(AD)$ bisects $\angle BAC$, we get
$\measuredangle BAD=\measuredangle DAC$.
Together with \ref{eq:<BAD=<CED},
it implies that 
$\measuredangle CEA=\measuredangle EAC$.
By Theorem~\ref{thm:isos}, $\triangle ACE$ is isosceles; 
that is, $$EC=AC.$$
Together with \ref{eq:AB/EC=DB/DC}, it implies \ref{bisect-ratio}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:ext-disect}
Prove an analog of Lemma~\ref{lem:bisect-ratio} for the external bisector.
\end{thm}



\section*{Incenter}
\addtocontents{toc}{Incenter.}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:incenter}
The angle bisectors of any nondegenerate triangle intersect at one point.
\end{thm}


The point of intersection of bisectors is called \index{incenter}\emph{incenter}; 
it is usually denoted as $I$.
The point $I$ lies on the same distance from each side,
it is the center of a circle tangent to each side of triangle.
This circle is called 
\index{incircle}\emph{incircle} and its radius is called 
\index{inradius}\emph{inradius} of the triangle.

\parit{Proof.} 
Let $\triangle ABC$ be a nondegenerate triangle.

Note that points $B$ and $C$ lie on the opposite sides from the bisector of $\angle BAC$.
Hence this bisector intersects $[BC]$ at a point, say $A'$.

Analogously, there is $B'\in[AC]$ 
such the $(BB')$ bisects $\angle ABC$.

\lbl[l]{33,16;$X$}
\lbl[r]{8,18;$Y$}
\lbl[rb]{11,23;$B'$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}


Applying Pasch's theorem (\ref{thm:pasch}), twice
for the triangles $\triangle AA'C$ and $\triangle BB'C$,
we get that $[AA']$ and $[BB']$ intersect.
Let us denote by $I$ the point of intersection.

Let $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be the foot points of $I$ on  $(B C)$, $(C A)$ and $(A B)$ correspondingly.
Applying Lemma~\ref{lem:angle-bisect-dist}, we get 
$$I Y=I Z=I X.$$
From the same lemma we get that $I$ lies on a bisector or exterior bisector of $\angle B C A$.

The line $(C I)$ intersects $[B B']$,
the points $B$ and $B'$ lie on opposite sides of $(C I)$.
Therefore  the angles $\angle I C B'$ and $\angle I C B$ have opposite signs.
Note that $\angle I C A=\angle I C B'$.
Therefore $(C I)$ can not be exterior bisector of $\angle B C A$.
Hence the result follows.
