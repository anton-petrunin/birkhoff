\section*{Real projective plane}
\addtocontents{toc}{Real projective plane.}

In the Euclidean plane two distinct lines might have one or zero points of intersection 
(in the later case the lines are called parallel).
Our aim is to extend Euclidean plane by ideal points so that any two distinct lines will have exactly one point of intersection.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{31mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/pensil-tip(1)}
\end{lpic}
\begin{lpic}[t(5mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/pensil-par(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

A collection of lines in the Euclidean plane is called \index{concurrent}\emph{concurrent} if they all intersect at single point or all of them pairwise parallel.
A set of concurrent lines passing through each point in the plane is called \index{pencil}\emph{pencil}.
There are two types of pencils 
first is the set of all lines passing through given point called the \index{center of the pencil}\emph{center of the pencil}
and  
second is the set of pairwise parallel lines.

Note that each point in Euclidean plane uniquely defines a pencil with center in it, 
but the parallel pencils have no center.
Also any two lines completely determine the pencil containing both.

Let us add one ideal point for each parallel pencil,
and assume that all these ideal points lie on one ideal line.

We obtain so called \index{real projective plane}\emph{real projective plane}.
Each point in the real projective plane defined as a pencil of lines in Euclidean plane.
We say that three points lie on one line the corresponding pencils contain a common line. 
(We assume that the ideal line belongs to each parallel pencil).


\section*{Euclidean space}
\addtocontents{toc}{Euclidean space.}

Let us repeat the construction of metric $d_2$ (page 
\pageref{def:d_2}) in the space.

We will denote by $\mathbb{R}^3$ the set of all triples $(x,y,z)$ of real numbers.
Assume $A=(x_A,y_A,z_A)$ and $B=(x_B,y_B,z_B)$ are arbitrary points.
Define the metric on $\mathbb{R}^3$ the following way
$$AB
\df
\sqrt{(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2+(z_A-z_B)^2}.$$
The obtained metric space is called \index{Euclidean space}\emph{Euclidean space}.

Assume at least one of the real numbers $a$, $b$ or $c$ is distinct from zero.
Then the subset of points $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^3$ 
described by equation
$$a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c\cdot z+d=0$$ 
is called \index{plane!plane in the space}\emph{plane};
here $d$ is a real number.

It is straightforward to show that any plane in Euclidean space is isometric to Euclidean plane.
Further, any three points on the space lie on one plane.
And any nonempty intersection of two distinct planes forms a line in each of these planes. 

The later statements makes possible to generalize many notions and results from Euclidean plane geometry to Euclidean space
by applying plane geometry in the planes of the space.

\section*{Perspective projection}
\addtocontents{toc}{Perspective projection.}

Consider two planes $\Pi$ and $\Pi'$ 
in the Euclidean space. 
Let $O$ be a point which does not belong neither to $\Pi$ nor $\Pi'$.

Consider the \index{perspective projection}\emph{perspective projection from $\Pi$ to $\Pi'$ with center at $O$}.
The projection of $P\in \Pi$
is defined as the point $P'\in\Pi'$ which lies on the line $(OP)$.

\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/perspective(1)}
\end{lpic} 
\end{center}

Note that the perspective projection sends collinear points to collinear.
Indeed, assume three points $P$, $Q$, $R$ lie on one line $\ell$ in $\Pi$
and $P'$, $Q'$, $R'$ are their images in $\Pi'$.
Then all the points $P$, $Q$, $R$, $P'$, $Q'$, $R'$ lie in the plane, say $\Theta$, containing $O$ and $\ell$.
Therefore the points $P',Q',R'$ lie in the line formed by intersection $\ell'=\Theta\cap \Pi'$.

The perspective projection is not a bijection between the planes;.
Indeed, if the line $(OP)$ is parallel to $\Pi'$ 
(that is, if $(OP)\cap\Pi'=\emptyset$)
then the perspective projection is not defined.
Also if  $(OP')\parallel \Pi$ 
for a point $P'\in \Pi'$
then point $P'$ is not an image of the perspective projection.

A similar story happened with inversion.
If inversion is considered for the Euclidean plane
then is not defied at the center of inversion;
it is also not the image of any point.
To deal with this problem we passed to inversive plane 
which is Euclidean plane extended by one ideal point.

A similar strategy works for perspective projection $\Pi\to\Pi'$, but this time real projective plane is the right choice of extension.
Denote by $\hat \Pi$ and $\hat \Pi'$ 
the corresponding real projective planes.

Note that there is a natural bijection between points in the real projective plane $\hat \Pi$ and all the lines passing through $O$.
If $P\in \Pi$ then take the line $(OP)$;
if $P$ is an ideal point of $\hat \Pi$, so defined by a parallel pencil of lines then take the line through $O$ which is parallel to each lines in this pencil. 

The same construction gives a bijection between points in the real projective plane $\hat \Pi'$ and all the lines passing through $O$.
Composing these bijections we get a bijection $\hat \Pi\to \hat \Pi'$ which coincides with the perspective projection $P\mapsto P'$
where it is defined.

Note that the ideal line of $\hat\Pi$ maps to the line formed by intersection of $\Pi'$ and the plane through $O$ parallel to $\Pi$.
Similarly the ideal line of $\hat\Pi'$
is the image of the line formed by intersection of $\Pi$ and the plane through $O$ parallel to $\Pi'$.

Strictly speaking this gives a transformation from one real projective plane to another, 
but if we identify the two planes, say by fixing a coordinate system in each, 
we get a projective transformation from the plane to itself. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:persect}
Let $O$ be the origin of $(x,y,z)$-coordinate space
and the planes $\Pi$ and $\Pi'$ formed by the solutions of equations
$x=1$ and $y=1$ correspondingly.
The perspective projection from $\Pi$ to $\Pi'$ with center at $O$ sends $P$ to $P'$.
Assume $P$ has coordinates $(1,y,z)$, find the coordinates of $P'$.

For which points $P\in \Pi$ the perspective projection is undefined?
Which points $P'\in\Pi'$ are not images of points under perspective projection?
\end{thm}

\section*{Projective transformations}
\addtocontents{toc}{Projective transformations.}

A bijection from real projective plane to itself 
which sends lines to lines 
is called \index{projective transformation}\emph{projective transformation}.

Projective and affine geometries study incidence structure of Euclidean and real projective plane correspondingly.
One may also say that
projective geometry studies the properties of real projective plane which preserved under projective transformations.


Note that any affine transformation defines  a projective transformation on the corresponding real projective plane.
We will call such projective transformations \index{affine transformation}\emph{affine}; 
these are projective transformations which send the ideal line to itself.

The perspective projection discussed in the previous section 
gives an example of projective transformation which is not affine.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Any projective transformation can be obtained as a composition of an affine transformation and a perspective projection.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $\alpha$ is a projective transformation. 
If is $\alpha$ sends ideal line to itself then it has to be affine. 
Hence the theorem follows.

Assume $\alpha$ sends the ideal line to line $\ell$, choose a perspective projection $\beta$ which sends $\ell$ back to the ideal line.
To do this we have to identify our plane with a plane $\Pi$ in the space, 
then fix a point $O\notin \Pi$  
and then choose a plane $\Pi'$ which is
parallel to the plane containing $\ell$ and $O$.

The composition $\beta\circ\alpha$ sends ideal line to itself,
therefore it has to be affine. 
Hence the result follows.

\section*{Desargues' theorem}
\addtocontents{toc}{Desargues' theorem.}

Loosely speaking, 
 any statement in projective geometry 
 can be formulated using only terms \index{collinear points}\emph{collinear points},
\emph{concurrent lines}.

Here is a classical example of a theorem in projective geometry.

\begin{thm}{Desargues' theorem}\label{thm:desargues}
Consider three concurrent lines $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ in the real projective plane.
Set
\begin{align*}
X&=(BC)\cap (B'C'),\\
Y&=(CA)\cap (C'A'),\\
Z&=(AB)\cap (A'B')
\end{align*}
Then the points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are collinear.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{44mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/desargues(0.9)}

\lbl[rw]{18,19;$C$}
\lbl[ltw]{29,20;$C'$}
\lbl[rw]{22,55;$Z$}
\lbl[rtw]{22.5,18;$X$}
\lbl[r]{23,4;$Y$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that the line $(XY)$ is ideal.
If not, apply a perspective projection which sends the line $(XY)$ to the ideal line.

In other words, we can assume that $(BC)\z\parallel (B'C')$ and  $(CA)\z\parallel (C'A')$ and we need to show that $(AB)\z\parallel(A'B')$.

Assume that the lines $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ intersect at point $O$.
Since $(BC)\parallel (B'C')$, 
Transversal property~\ref{thm:parallel-2}, implies that that $\measuredangle OBC\z\equiv \measuredangle OB'C'$ and $\measuredangle OCB\z\equiv \measuredangle OC'B'$.
By AA-similarity condition, $\triangle OBC\z\sim\triangle OB'C'$.
In particular,
\[\frac{OB}{OB'}=\frac{OC}{OC'}.\]

\begin{wrapfigure}{i}{48mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/desargues-par(1)}
\lbl[r]{15,32;$A$}
\lbl[lw]{35,42;$A'$}
\lbl[rw]{13,24;$B$}
\lbl[rbw]{29,27;$B'$}
\lbl[rw]{18,19;$C$}
\lbl[lw]{43,18;$C'$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

The same way we get $\triangle OAC\z\sim\triangle OA'C'$ and
\[\frac{OA}{OA'}=\frac{OC}{OC'}.\]
Therefore 
\[\frac{OA}{OA'}=\frac{OB}{OB'}.\]
By SAS-similarity condition, we get $\triangle OAB\sim\triangle OA'B'$,
in particular $\measuredangle OAB\equiv \pm \measuredangle OA'B'$.

Note that $\measuredangle AOB\equiv \measuredangle A'OB'$.
Therefore 
\[\measuredangle OAB\equiv \measuredangle OA'B'.\]
By Transversal property~\ref{thm:parallel-2},
$(AB)\parallel (A'B')$.

The case when the lines $(AA')\parallel(BB')\parallel(CC')$ can be done similarly.
In this case the quadrilaterals $B'BCC'$ and $A'ACC'$ are parallelograms.
Therefore 
\[BB'=CC'=AA'.\]
Whence $B'BAA'$ is a parallelogram, in particular $(AB)\parallel (A'B')$.

Here is an other classical theorem of of projective geometry.

\begin{thm}{Pappus's theorem}\label{thm:pappus}
Assume that two triples of points $A$, $B$, $C$,
and $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ are collinear.
Set 
\begin{align*}
X&=(BC')\cap(B'C),
&
Y&=(CA')\cap(C'A),
&
Z&=(AB')\cap(A'B).
\end{align*}
Then the points $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are collinear.
\end{thm}


\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/pappus(1)}
\lbl[lb]{3,23;$A$}
\lbl[tw]{3,2;$A'$}

\lbl[lw]{18,16;$X$}
\lbl[bw]{11,16;$Y$}
\lbl[rw]{5.5,14;$Z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

Pappus's theorem can be proved the same way as Desargues' theorem.

\parit{Idea of the proof.}
Applying a perspective projection, we can assume that $X$ and $Y$ lie on the ideal line.
It remains to show that $Z$ lies on the ideal line.

In other words, assuming that $(AB')\parallel (A'B)$ and $(AC')\parallel (A'C)$, we need to show that $(BC')\parallel(B'C)$.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:pappus}
Finish the proof of Pappus's theorem using the idea described above.
\end{thm}





\section*{Duality}
\addtocontents{toc}{Duality.}

Let us fix a bijection between the set of lines and the set of points of the plane.
Given a point $P$ let us denote by lower case letter $p$ the corresponding line.
Also the other way around, 
given a line $s$ we will denote upper case letter $S$ the corresponding point. 

The bijection between points and lines is called \index{duality}\emph{duality}\label{page:duality}%
\footnote{Usual definition of duality is more general; we consider a special case which is also called \index{polarity}\emph{polarity}.}
if 
\[P\in s\ \ \iff\ \  p\ni S.\]
for any point $P$ and line $s$.

Existence of duality in a plane 
says that the lines and the points in this plane have the same rights in terms of incidence.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:dual-euclid}
Show that Euclidean plane does not admit a duality. 
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:dual}
The real projective plane admits a duality.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Consider a plane $\Pi$ and a point $O\notin\Pi$ 
in the Euclidean space;
denote by $\hat \Pi$ the corresponding real projective plane.

Recall that there is a natural bijection between points in the real projective plane $\hat \Pi$ and all the lines passing through $O$.
If $P\in \Pi$ then the corresponding line is $(OP)$;
if $P$ is an ideal point of $\hat \Pi$, 
so $P$ is defined as a parallel pencil of lines,
take the line through $O$ which is parallel to each lines in this pencil. 
Given $P\in\hat \Pi$,
denote the obtained line $\dot P$.

Similarly there is a natural bijection between lines in  $\hat \Pi$ and all the planes passing through $O$.
If is $s$ is a line in $\Pi$ then take the plane containing $O$ and $s$;
if $s$ is the ideal line of $\hat \Pi$,
take the plane through $O$ parallel to $\Pi$. 
Given a line $s$ in $\hat \Pi$,
denote the obtained plane as $\dot s$.

It is straightforward to check that $\dot P\subset\dot s$
if and only if $P\in s$;
that is, the bijections $P\mapsto \dot P$ and $s\mapsto \dot s$
remember all the incidence structure of the real projective plane $\hat \Pi$.

It remains to construct a bijection $\dot s\mapsto \dot S$
between the set of planes and 
the set of lines passing through $O$ 
such that 
\[\dot r\subset \dot S\ \ \iff \ \ \dot R\supset \dot s
\eqlbl{iff-dual}\]
for any two lines line $\dot r$ and $\dot s$ passing through $O$.

Set $\dot S$ to be the plane through $O$ 
which is perpendicular to $\dot s$.
Note that both conditions \ref{iff-dual} are equivalent to $\dot r\perp \dot s$;
hence the result follows.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:dula-coordinates}
Consider Euclidean plane with $(x,y)$-coordinates, denote by $O$ the origin.
Given a point $P\ne O$ with coordinates $(a,b)$ consider the line $p$ 
formed by solution of the equation 
$a\cdot x+b\cdot y=1$.

Show that the correspondence $P$ to $p$ extends to duality of corresponding real projective plane.

Which line corresponds to $O$?

Which point of real projective plane corresponds to the line formed by solutions $a\cdot x+b\cdot y=0$?
\end{thm}

The existence of duality in the real projective planes makes possible to formulate an equivalent dual statement to any statement in projective geometry.
Say, the dual statement for ``the points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ lie on one line $\ell$''
would be the ``lines $x$, $y$ and $z$ intersect at one point $L$''.

For example the dual statement for Desargues' theorem~\ref{thm:desargues} is its converse.
 

\begin{thm}{Dual Desargues' theorem}
Consider the collinear points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$.
Assume that $X\z=(BC)\cap (B'C')$, $Y\z=(CA)\cap (C'A')$ and $Z=(AB)\cap (A'B')$.
Then the lines  $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ are concurrent.
\end{thm}

In this theorem the points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ 
are dual to the lines $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ in the original formulation, and the other way around.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:dual-pappus}
Formulate Dual Pappus's theorem, see \ref{thm:pappus}.
\end{thm}

Proving Desargues' theorem 
and applying duality (Theorem~\ref{thm:dual})
we get Dual Desargues' theorem.
The same can be done the other way around.

The Desargues' theorem and its dual can be packed in the
following strong version of Desargues' theorem.

\begin{thm}{Strong Desargues' theorem}
Assume that $X\z=(BC)\z\cap (B'C')$, $Y\z=(CA)\cap (C'A')$ and $Z=(AB)\cap (A'B')$.
Then the lines  $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ are concurrent if and only if the  points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are collinear.
\end{thm}

\section*{Axioms}
\addtocontents{toc}{Axioms.}

Note that the real projective plane described above satisfies the following set of axioms.

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
\item\label{def:proj-axioms:1} Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
\item\label{def:proj-axioms:2} Any two distinct lines pass through a unique point.
\item\label{def:proj-axioms:3} There exist at least four points of which no three are collinear.
\end{enumerate}

Let us take these three axioms as a definition of \index{projective plane}\emph{projective plane};
so the real projective plane discussed above becomes a particular example of projective plane.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:finite-pp}
Show that any line in projective plane contains at least three points.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/fano(1)}
%\lbl[r]{15,32;$A$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

It turns out that there is a projective plane which contains exactly 3 points on each line.
This is so called \index{Fano plane}\emph{Fano plane} which you can see on the diagram;
it contains $7$ points and $7$ lines.
This is an example of \index{finite projective plane}\emph{finite projective plane};
that is, projective plane with finitely many points.

Consider the following analog of Axiom~\ref{def:proj-axioms:3}.

\medskip

\noindent {\rm III$'$.} 
There exist at least four lines of which no three are concurrent.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:3=3'}
Show that Axiom \ref{def:proj-axioms:3}$\,'$ is equivalent to Axiom \ref{def:proj-axioms:3}.
\end{thm}

Exercise above show that in the axiomatic system of projective plane,
lines and points have the same rights.
In fact one can switch everywhere words ``point'' with ``line'', ``pass trough'' with ``lies on'', ``collinear'' with ``concurrent'' and we get an equivalent set of axioms.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:oder}
Assume that one of the lines in a finite projective plane contains exactly $n+1$ points.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{ex:oder:a} Show that each line contains exactly $n+1$ points.
\item\label{ex:oder:b} Show that the number of the points in the plane has to be 
\[n^2+n+1.\]
\item\label{ex:oder:c} Show that in any finite projective plane the number of points coincides with the number of lines.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

The number $n$ in the above exercise is called \index{order of finite projective plane}\emph{order} of finite projective plane.
For example Fano plane has order $2$.
Here is one of the most famous conjecture in finite geometry.

\begin{thm}{Conjecture}
The order of a finite projective plane is the power of a prime.
\end{thm}
