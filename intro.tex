The book is meant to be 
rigorous, 
conservative, 
elementary and
minimalistic.
At the same time it includes about the maximum what students can absorb in one semester.

Approximately third of the material used to be covered in high school, not any more.

The present book is based 
on the courses taught by the author 
at the Penn State 
as an introduction into Foundations of Geometry.
The lectures were oriented to sophomore and senior university students.  
These students already had a calculus course.
In particular they are familiar with the real numbers and continuity.
It makes possible to cover the material faster 
and  in a more rigorous way
than it could be done in high school.



\section*{Prerequisite}
\addtocontents{toc}{Prerequisite.}

The students has to be familiar 
with the following topics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Elementary set theory: 
$\in$,
$\cup$, 
$\cap$,
$\backslash$,
$\subset$,
$\times$.
\item Real numbers: intervals, inequalities, algebraic identities.
\item Limits, continuous functions and  Intermediate value theorem.
\item Standard functions: 
absolute value, 
natural logarithm,
exponent. 
Occasionally, trigonometric functions  are used, 
but these parts can be ignored.
\item  Chapter~\ref{chap:trans} 
use matrix algebra of $2{\times}2$-matrices.
\item To read Chapter~\ref{chap:sphere}, it is better to have some previous experience with {}\emph{scalar product}, also known as {}\emph{dot product}.
\item To read Chapter~\ref{chap:complex}, it is better to have some previous experience with complex numbers.
\end{itemize} 

\section*{Overview}
\addtocontents{toc}{Overview.}

We use so called {}\emph{metric approach} introduced by Birkhoff.
It means that we define Euclidean plane as a {}\emph{metric space} which satisfies a list of properties.
This way we minimize the tedious parts
which are unavoidable in the more classical Hilbert's approach.
At the same time the students have chance to learn basic geometry of metric spaces.

In the Chapter~\ref{chap:metr} we give all definitions necessary to formulate the axioms;
it includes metric space, lines, angle measure, continuous maps and congruent triangles.

Euclidean geometry is discussed in the chapters \ref{chap:axioms}--\ref{chap:triangle}.
In the  Chapter~\ref{chap:axioms}, we formulate the axioms and prove immediate corollaries.
In the chapters \ref{chap:half-planes}--\ref{chap:parallel} 
we develop Euclidean geometry to a dissent level.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:triangle} we give the most classical theorem of triangle geometry;
this chapter included mainly as an illustration.

In the chapters \ref{chap:inscribed-angle}--\ref{chap:inversion} we discuss geometry of circles on the Euclidean plane. 
These two chapters 
will be used in the construction of the model of hyperbolic plane.

In the chapters \ref{chap:non-euclid}--\ref{chap:h-plane}
we discuss non-Euclidean geometry.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:non-euclid},
we introduce the axioms of absolute geometry.
In Chapter~\ref{chap:poincare}
we describe so called Poincar\'e disc model (discovered by Beltrami).
This is a construction of hyperbolic plane,
an example of absolute plane which is not Euclidean.
In the Chapter \ref{chap:h-plane} we discuss geometry of the constructed hyperbolic plane.

Chapters \ref{chap:trans} 
and 
\ref{chap:proj} 
discuss so called {}\emph{incidence geometry},
it includes affine and projective geometries.

The last few chapters contain additional topics:
Spherical geometry, 
Klein model,
Complex coordinates
and Geometric constructions.
The proofs in these chapters are not completely rigorous.

\section*{Disclaimer}

I am not doing history.
It is  impossible to find the original reference to most of the theorems discussed here, so I do not even try.
Most of the proofs discussed in the book 
appeared already in the Euclid's Elements
and the  Elements are not the original source anyway.

\section*{Recommended books}

\begin{itemize}
\item Kiselev's textbook \cite{kiselev} ---
a classical book for school students.
Should help if you have trouble to follow my book.

\item Moise's book, \cite{moise} ---
should be good for further study.

\item Greenberg's book \cite{greenberg}  --- a historical tour through the axiomatic systems of various geometries.

\item Prasolov's book \cite{prasolov} is perfect to master your problem-solving skills. 

\item Methodologically my lectures
were very close to Sharygin's  textbook \cite{sharygin}.
Which I recommend to anyone who can read Russian.

I would like to thank  
Matthew Chao for thoughtful reading 
and correcting dozens of mistakes.
