## How to build

The following command will create a local copy of the source code for you.

`git clone https://github.com/anton-petrunin/birkhoff.git`

Go to the crated folder, and run `mpost`, `pdflatex` and `makeindex` few times; it worked with full installation of TeX Live on Kubuntu 16.04.

`cd birkhoff/mpics/`<br/>
`mpost pic.mp`<br/>
`mpost pic-hints.mp`<br/>
`cd ..`<br/>
`pdflatex all-lectures.tex`<br/>
`makeindex all-lectures`<br/>
`pdflatex all-lectures.tex`<br/>
`biber all-lectures`<br/>
`makeindex all-lectures`<br/>
`pdflatex all-lectures.tex`<br/>

the following command will extract all needed files in arXiv.tar:

`tar -cvf arXiv.tar --files-from list-of-files.txt`
