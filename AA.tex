To prove the converse, let us argue by contradiction.
Assume that \ref{eq:inscribed-angle} holds for some $P\notin \Gamma$.
Note that $\measuredangle X O Y\ne 0$ and therefore $\measuredangle X P Y$ is distinct from $0$ and $\pi$;
that is, $\triangle PXY$ is nondegenerate.

If the line $(PY)$ is secant to $\Gamma$, denote by $P'$ the point of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $(PY)$ which is distinct from $Y$.
From above we get 
$$2\cdot\measuredangle X P' Y
\equiv
\measuredangle X O Y.$$
In particular, 
$$2\cdot\measuredangle X P' Y
\equiv
2\cdot\measuredangle X P Y.$$
By Transversal property (\ref{thm:parallel-2}),
$(P'X)\parallel (PX)$.
Since $\triangle PXY$ is nondegenerate,
the later implies $P=P'$, which contradicts $P\notin \Gamma$.

In the remaining case, if $(PY)$ is tangent to $\Gamma$,
the proof goes along the same lines.
Namely, by Theorem~\ref{thm:tangent-angle},
$$2\cdot\measuredangle P Y X
\equiv
\measuredangle Y O X.$$
Therefore 
$$2\cdot(\measuredangle X P Y + \measuredangle P Y X)
\equiv0.$$

By Transversal property~\ref{thm:parallel-2},
$(PY)\z\parallel (XY)$;
therefore $(PY)\z= (XY)$.
That is, $\triangle PXY$ is degenerate,
a contradiction.













\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:center-proj}.}
Follows from Theorem \ref{thm:circle-center-proj} the same way as the exercises~\ref{ex:affine-perp} and \ref{ex:midpoint-proj}.








\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:affine+circles}.}
According to Exercise~\ref{ex:center-circ-affine}, the transformation has to send center of the circle to the center of its image.

Assume that the transformation is given as
\[\beta\:\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\ y
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
  \mapsto
  \left(\begin{smallmatrix}
a&b\\ c&d
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
  \cdot
  \left(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\ y
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
  +
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
v\\ w
\end{smallmatrix} \right).
\]
Applying the parallel translation we may assume that the origin did not move; i.e., $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
v\\ w
\end{smallmatrix} \right)=0$.
Applying a homothety we may assume that unit circle centered at the origin is mapped to itself.
Since $\beta\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
1\\ 0
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
=
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
a\\c 
\end{smallmatrix} \right)$,
$\beta\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
0\\ 1
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
=
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
b\\d 
\end{smallmatrix} \right)$ 
and 
$\beta\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
1/\sqrt{2}\\ 1/\sqrt{2}
\end{smallmatrix} \right)
=
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
(a+b)/\sqrt{2}\\(c+d)/\sqrt{2} 
\end{smallmatrix} \right)$
we get
\begin{align*}
a^2+c^2&=1\\
b^2+d^2&=1\\
(a+b)^2+(c+d)^2&=2.
\end{align*}
It follows that the matrix takes one of two forms $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
a&b\\ -b&a
\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$
or 
$\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
a&b\\ b&-a
\end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ where $a^2+b^2=1$;
i.e., the map is a motion of the plane.




\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:Moebius=inversive}.}
Follows from
Exercise~\ref{ex:invesion-Mob}.













\begin{thm}{Proposition}
The identity map in a group of transformations on set $\mathcal X$ can be distinguished
from all the other transformations as the unique transformation $\iota$ such that
\[\iota\circ\alpha=\alpha
\eqlbl{eps-circ-alpha}\] 
for any transformation $\alpha$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $\iota$ is the identity map;
i.e., $\iota(x)=x$ for any  $x$.
Then 
\[\iota\circ\alpha(x)=\iota(\alpha(x))=\alpha(x).\]
Hence \ref{eps-circ-alpha} follows.

Assume $\iota'$ is a transformation which satisfies \ref{eps-circ-alpha}.
Then 
\[\iota'(x)=\iota'(\iota(x))=\iota'\circ\iota(x)=\iota(x).\]
The later implies $\iota'=\iota$.
\qeds














The group motions of plane (Euclidean or hyperbolic or absolute) is equipped with natural binary operation, given two motions $\alpha$ and$\beta$ one can take its composition $\alpha\circ\beta$.
Also, for any motion $\alpha$,
its inverse $\alpha^{-1}$ is a motion of the plane.












\parit{Second proof.}
Consider such a configuration in the Euclidean space.
Assume in addition that the lines $(AA')$, $(BB')$ and $(CC')$ do not lie in one plane and intersect at point $O$.

Denote by $(PQR)$ the plane passing through three points.

Nothe that
\begin{align*}
(AB)&= (OAB)\cap (ABC),&
(A'B')&= (OAB)\cap (A'B'C'),\\
(BC)&= (OBC)\cap (ABC),&
(B'C')&= (OBC)\cap (A'B'C'),\\
(CA)&= (OCA)\cap (ABC),&
(C'A')&= (OCA)\cap (A'B'C').
\end{align*}
Further
\begin{align*}
X&=(BC)\cap(B'C')=(OBC)\cap (ABC)\cap (A'B'C'),\\
Y&=(CA)\cap(C'A')=(OCA)\cap (ABC)\cap (A'B'C'),\\
Z&=(AB)\cap(A'B')=(OAB)\cap (ABC)\cap (A'B'C').
\end{align*}
Note that $(ABC)\cap (A'B'C')$ is a line and
\[X,Y,Z\in (ABC)\cap (A'B'C');\]
i.e., the points are collinear. 
Passing  to the orthogonal projection of this configuration to a plane proves proves the theorem.

Applying a perspective projection,
the case $(AA')\parallel(BB')\parallel(CC')$ 
can be reduced to the one discussed above.

The idealized ruler can be used only to draw a line through given two points. (The ruler is assumed to be infinite in length, and it has no markings on it and only one edge.)
The idealized ruler and compass can be used only to draw a circle with given center and radius.
We may always mark an additional point in the plane
as well as on the constructed sets, lines or circles or on their intersections.
Doing this we have no control on the choice the additional point. 

We can also look at the different set of instruments, 
for example
you may only use the ruler;
you may invent your own instruments, for example an instrument which produce midpoint for given two points, 
or produce a circle or line which pass through given three points.
Thanks to number of computer programs which were developed in the last few years, one can play with these these instruments as well.

Any construction problem starts with the \index{initial configuration}\emph{initial configuration},
it is finite collection of points, lines, circles
and asked for an algorithm of constructing some other configuration of points.

A construction is a finite sequence of the following five basic constructions which use the points, lines and circles that have already been constructed. 
These are:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Draw the line through two marked points;
\item Draw the circle through one marked point with center at another marked point;
\item Mark the point which is the intersection of two constructed lines (if they intersect);
\item Mark the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect);
\item Mark the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect);
\end{enumerate}

The rules above describe the classical compass-and-ruler constructions. 
But one can look at the different instruments, for example
you may only consider ruler,
you may invent your own instruments, for example an instrument which produce midpoint for given two points, or produce a circle or line which pass through given three points.
Thanks to number of computer programs which were developed in the last few years, one can play with these these instruments as well.

($\Rightarrow$).
If $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ lie on one line then both $\ang ABC$ and $\ang CDA$ are zero or straight. 
Hence \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle} follows.

If $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ lie on one circle,
denote by $O$ the center of the circle.
According to Theorem~\ref{thm:inscribed-angle},
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\measuredangle ABC
&\equiv\measuredangle AOB,
\\
2\cdot\measuredangle CDA
&\equiv\measuredangle BOA.
\end{align*}
Adding these two identities, we get \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle}.

\parit{}($\Leftarrow$).
Assume \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle} holds.


If $\triangle ABC$ is degenerate
then according to Corollary~\ref{cor:degenerate=pi}, $\measuredangle ABC=0$ or $\pi$.
From \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle}, $\measuredangle CDA=0$ or $\pi$.
Applying Corollary~\ref{cor:degenerate=pi} again,
we get $B,D\in (AC)$; 
that is, all points $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ lie on one line.

If $\triangle ABC$ is nondegenerate,
denote by $\Gamma$ the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
Applying the ``only if'' part of Theorem~\ref{thm:inscribed-angle}, we get the result.












From \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle}, $\measuredangle ADC\not\equiv 0$ nor $\pi$;
therefore $\triangle CDA$ is nondegenerate and in particular

$$(DA)\ne (CD).\eqlbl{eq:DAnpCD}$$


Now we need to consider two cases. 

\parit{Case 1.} Assume $(CD)$ is secant of $\Gamma$.
Denote by $D'$ be the point of intersection $\Gamma$ and $(CD)$ which is distinct from $C$.
From \ref{eq:inscribed-4angle} and the ``only if''-part, we get
$$2\cdot \measuredangle ADC\equiv2\cdot \measuredangle AD'C.$$
According to Corollary~\ref{cor:parallel-2}, 

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{45mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-5mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/inscribed-angle-4b(1)}

\lbl[rb]{5,35;$B$}
\lbl[lb]{43,20;$C$}
\lbl[l]{41,8;$D$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

$$(DA)\z\parallel(D'A).$$
Hence $(DA)\z=(D'A)$. 
From \ref{eq:DAnpCD} we get $D=D'$;
hence the result follows.

\parit{Case 2.} Now assume $(CD)$ is tangent of $\Gamma$.
Let $O$ denotes the center of $\Gamma$.
Then
by Theorem~\ref{thm:tangent-angle}
$$2\cdot\measuredangle ACD\equiv \measuredangle AOC.$$


According to Theorem~\ref{thm:inscribed-angle},
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\measuredangle ABC&\equiv\measuredangle AOC.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\measuredangle DCA+2\cdot\measuredangle ABC\equiv0.
\end{align*}

According to Corollary~\ref{cor:parallel-2}, $(DC)\z\parallel(DA)$. 
Therefore $D\in (AC)$ which contradicts \ref{eq:DAnpCD}.
















First note that if $(AD)\perp(BC)$ then by angle-side-angle condition $\triangle A D B\cong\triangle ADC$.
In particular $AB=AC$ and $DB=DC$; hence \ref{bisect-ratio} follows.

In the remaining case we may assume that $\ang B D A$ is obtuse (otherwise switch labels of $B$ and $C$).

Choose a point $D'\not=D$ on $(AD)$ such that $B D\z=B D'$ (it exists due to Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent}).

Since $\measuredangle DAB\equiv-\measuredangle DAC$,
the point
$D$ lies between $C$ and $B$.
Since $\triangle BDD'$ is isosceles,
angle $\ang BDD'$ is acute.
On the other hand $\ang B D A$ is obtuse, 
which implies that $D$ lies between $A$ and $D'$.

In particular the angles $\ang C D A$ and $\ang B D D'$ are vertical.
Since $\triangle D B D'$ is isosceles, we have 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle B D' A&\equiv \measuredangle B D' D\equiv
\\
&\equiv -\measuredangle B D D'\equiv
\\
&\equiv -\measuredangle C D A
\end{align*}
Since $(AD)$ bisects $\ang B A C$, we have $\measuredangle DAB\equiv -\measuredangle D A C$.
Applying the AA condition, we get $\triangle ADC\sim \triangle A D' B$.
Thus,
$$\frac{DB}{DC}=\frac{D' B}{DC}=\frac{AB}{AC}.$$

\section*{Area of spherical triangle\footnote{This is a slightly modified version of ``Area of a spherical triangle''  by Thomas Foregger, Igor Khavkine, John Smith. Freely available at \href{http://planetmath.org/AreaOfASphericalTriangle.html}{PlanetMath.org}.}}
\addtocontents{toc}{Area of spherical triangle.}

\begin{wrapfigure}[9]{o}{31mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(-0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/s-trig-my-1(1)}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

A spherical triangle is formed by connecting three points, its vertices, 
on the surface of a sphere with great arcs.
The spherical triangle with vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ will be denoted by $\triangle_s ABC$.

The angle at each vertex is measured 
as the angle between the tangents to the sides.

The following theorem is analogous to Corollary~\ref{cor:area-h-trig}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:s-trig-area}
Let $\triangle_s ABC$ be a spherical triangle on a unit sphere.
Denote by $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ the internal angles of $\triangle_s ABC$ 
at $A$, $B$ and $C$ correspondingly.
Then
$$\area (\triangle_s ABC) = \alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi.$$

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
The sum of the internal angles of a spherical
triangle is greater than or equal to $\pi$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a spherical $n$-gon 
with the internal angles $\alpha_1,\z\dots,\alpha_n$.
Then 
$$\area\mathcal{P}=\alpha_1+\dots+\alpha_n-\pi\cdot(n-2).$$

\end{thm}

In the following proof, we use that area of unit sphere is $4\cdot\pi$.
This fact follows from the formula for area of surface of revolution;
we do not present these calculations here.

On the picture above, you see a spherical triangle $\triangle_sABC$.
Note that by continuing the sides of the original triangle into
great circles, another spherical triangle is formed. The triangle $\triangle_sA'B'C'$
is antipodal to $\triangle_sABC$; it can be obtained by reflecting $\triangle_sABC$ through $O$. 
By symmetry, both triangles must
have the same area.

\parit{Proof.}
The \index{spherical diangle}\emph{spherical diangle} is a subset of the sphere which is bounded by two great arcs that intersect in two points, which must lie on a diameter. 

Six diangles
with vertices on the diameters $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$ are shown on the picture.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pics/img4}\ \ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pics/img5}\ \ 
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pics/img6}
\end{figure}

Clearly, a diangle occupies an area that is proportional to the absolute value of the angle measure. 
Since the area of the sphere
is $4\cdot\pi$, 
the area of the diangles are $2\cdot\alpha$, $2\cdot\beta$ and $2\cdot\gamma$ correspondingly.

Note that these 6 diangles cover the entire sphere while overlapping
only on the triangles $\triangle_s ABC$ and $\triangle_s A'B'C'$;
the diangles cover these triangles three times and the remaining part of sphere only once.
Therefore 
$$
4\cdot\pi + 4\cdot\area(\triangle_s ABC)= 4\cdot \alpha+4\cdot \beta+4\cdot\gamma.
$$
Hence, the result follows.
\qeds













\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:sum-trig-h}
Given three positive real numbers $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ such that
$$\alpha+\beta+\gamma<\pi$$ 
there is a hyperbolic triangle $\triangle_hABC$
such that with
$$|\measuredangle_hCAB|=\alpha,\ \ |\measuredangle_hABC|=\beta\ \ \text{and}\ \ |\measuredangle_hBCA|=\gamma.\eqlbl{eq:abc}$$
 
Moreover this triangle is uniquely determined up to congruence. 
\end{thm}

%???PIC

\parit{Proof.}
Set 
$$\epsilon=(\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma)/2.$$
Note that there is a Euclidean triangle $\triangle ABC$ such that 
$$\measuredangle CAB=\alpha,\ \ \measuredangle ABC=\beta+\epsilon\ \ \text{and}\ \ \measuredangle BCA=\gamma+\epsilon.$$

Let us construct an arc $BQC$
such that if $[BX)$ and $[CY)$ are tangents half-lines to arc $BQC$
at $B$ and $C$ then $\measuredangle CBX=\measuredangle ACY=-\epsilon$.
Denote by $\Gamma$ the circle containing arc $BQC$.

Note that $O$ lies outside of $\Gamma$.
Draw a line $(AW)$ which is tangent to $\Gamma$ at $W$.
In this case the circle $\Omega$ centered at $A$  and passing through $W$
is perpendicular to $\Gamma$.
Note that $\triangle_h ABC$ in the model with absolute $\Omega$ satisfies \ref{eq:abc}. 

To prove the last statement, first note that we can assume that $A$ is the center of absolute.
In this case, if $\triangle_hABC$ satisfies \ref{eq:abc}
then $\triangle ABC$ has angles with measures 
$\pm \alpha$, $\pm \beta+\epsilon$ and $\gamma+\epsilon$
and the arc forming $[BC]_h$ is completely determined by  $B$, $C$ and $\epsilon$.
Therefore if $W$ is an ideal point of $(BC)_h$ then $\tfrac {AB}{AW}$ and $\tfrac {AC}{AW}$ are completely determined by $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
Therefore so are the h-distances $AB_h$ and $AC_h$. 
It remains to apply SAS congruence condition in h-plane.

\section*{Existence of area}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Given a finite collection of polygonal regions $\mathcal{R}_1,\mathcal{R}_2,\dots, 
\end{thm}


Fix small $\epsilon>0$.
Given a polygonal region $\mathcal R$,
consider the maximal integer number $n$ such that there are $n$ points $P_1,P_2,\dots P_n$ in $\mathcal R$ such that $P_iP_j>\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$.
Set $\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R=n$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that $\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R$ is well defined integer number for any polygonal region.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:bounded}
For any polygonal region $\mathcal R$ there is a constant $C$ such that
$$\epsilon^2\cdot\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R\le C$$
for any $\epsilon>0$.

Moreover if $\mathcal R$ is nondegenerate then there is a constrant $c>0$ such that 
$$\epsilon^2\cdot\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R> c$$
for any $\epsilon>0$.
\end{thm}

There is a set-theoretical monster-construction
which named \emph{ultralimit}.
Given a bounded sequence of real numbers $(x_n)=(x_1,x_2,\dots)$,
it gives a real number $\mathfrak{F}(x_n)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $x=\mathfrak{F}(x_n)$ is a partial limit of the sequence $x_1,x_2,\dots$; i.e., $x$ is a limit of a subsequence of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$.
\item $\mathfrak{F}(x_n+y_n)=\mathfrak{F}(x_n)+\mathfrak{F}(y_n)$;
i.e., given two bounded sequences of real numbers $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$, consider sequence $(z_n)$ such that $z_n=x_n+y_n$ for each $n$ then $\mathfrak{F}(z_n)=\mathfrak{F}(x_n)+\mathfrak{F}(y_n)$.
\item $\mathfrak{F}(c\cdot x_n)=c\cdot \mathfrak{F}(x_n)$;
i.e., given two bounded sequence of real numbers $(x_n)$ and a real number $c$, consider sequence $(z_n)$ such that $z_n=c\cdot x_n$ for each $n$ then $\mathfrak{F}(z_n)=c\cdot \mathfrak{F}(x_n)$.
\end{itemize}

The construction is not unique. 
For the sequence $x_n=(-1)^n$,
depending on the construction we might have $\mathfrak{F}(x_n)=1$ or $\mathfrak{F}(x_n)=-1$.

We will need only existence of one such construction
and we are not going to prove. %REF???

Note that if $x_n$ converges then
$$\mathfrak{F}(x_n)=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n.$$
The ultralimits behave unpredictably when you pass to a subsequence.
 while
$\mathfrak{F}(x_n)=1$.
In fact it is true that if $\mathfrak{F}(x_n)$ does not depend on the choice of  $\mathfrak{F}$ then the sequence $(x_n)$ is converging.

Let $\mathcal R$ be a polygonal region.
Consider sequence $(x_n)$ with elements
$$x_n=\frac{\pack_{1/n} \mathcal R}{n^2}.$$
Note that according to the Exercise~\ref{ex:bounded} the sequence $x_n$ is bounded.
Define 
$$s(\mathcal R)=\mathfrak{F}(x_n).$$

Note that $x_n\ge 0$ for any $n$, therefore 
$$s(\mathcal R)\ge 0$$
for any polygonal region $\mathcal R$.
According to Exercise~\ref{ex:bounded},
$$s(\mathcal R)> 0$$
for any nongedenerate polygonal regions.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\mathcal R_1$ and $\mathcal R_2$ be  two polygonal regions.
Show that there is a constant $C$ such tat
\begin{align*}
\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R_1 +\pack_\epsilon\mathcal R_2 &-C\cdot\epsilon\le
\\
\le
\pack_\epsilon (\mathcal R_1&\cup\mathcal R_2) +\pack_\epsilon (\mathcal R_1\cap\mathcal R_2)
\le 
\\
&\le
\pack_\epsilon \mathcal R_1 +\pack_\epsilon\mathcal R_2 +C\cdot\epsilon.
\end{align*}

Conclude that 
$$s(\mathcal{R}_1)+s (\mathcal{R}_2)=s(\mathcal{R}_1\cup\mathcal{R}_2)+s(\mathcal{R}_1\cap\mathcal{R}_2)$$
for any two polygonal regions $\mathcal R_1$ and $\mathcal R_2$.
\end{thm}

Denote by $\mathcal{Q}_1$ the unit square.
From the last exercise it follows that if one sets
$$\area\mathcal{R}=s(\mathcal{R})/s(\mathcal{Q}_1),$$
then the obtained functional satisfies all the properties of area.

\section*{Uniqueness of area}

Once the existence of area functional is proved we can use the properties of area alone to find the area of different polygonal regions.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Any degenerate polygonal region has zero area.
In particular, the are of segment is zero.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
The area of rectangular region with sides $a$ and $b$ is equal to $a\cdot b$. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Area of triangular region is equal to ...
\end{thm}

Finally note that any polygonal region can be presented as a union of finite number of triangles in such a way that distinct triangle do not have common points inside.
Applying the 

???

Consider triangle $\triangle ABC$.
Recall that altitude at $A$ is the distance from $A$ to its foot point on $(BC)$
Denote the altitude at $A$, $B$ and $C$ by $h_a$, $h_b$ and $h_c$ correspondingly.
Set $a=BC$, $b=CA$ and $c=AB$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that 
$$h_a\cdot a=h_b\cdot b=h_c\cdot c.$$
\end{thm}


Let us define area of triangle $\triangle ABC$ the following way.
$$\area \triangle ABC= \tfrac12\cdot h_a\cdot a.
$$
From the above exercise we get that 

$$\area \triangle ABC=\area \triangle BAC=\area ACB=\dots$$


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $D$ lies between $B$ and $C$.
Show that 
$$\area \triangle ABC=\area \triangle ABD+\area \triangle ADC$$
\end{thm}



Given triangle $\triangle ABC$ denote by
$h_a$ to be the distance from $A$ to its foot point on $(BC)$;
the value $h_a$ sometimes called altitude 

Let us first define area of triangle as

is the union of segments $[A_1A_2]$, $[A_2A_3]$, ..., $[A_{n-1}A_n]$
and  \index{broken line!closed broken line}\emph{closed broken line} $A_1A_2\dots A_n$
is the union of segments $[A_1A_2]$, $[A_2A_3]$, ..., $[A_{n-1}A_n]$, $[A_nA_1]$.
A closed broken line  $A_1A_2\dots A_n$ is called \index{broken line!simple closed broken line}\emph{simple} if the segments  $[A_1A_2]$, $[A_2A_3], \z\dots,[A_{n-1}A_n]$ intersect each other only at the common ends.

The set $\mathcal{P}$ bounded by simple closed broken line $A_1A_2\dots A_n$ is called
\index{polygon}\emph{polygon} or \index{$n$-gon}\emph{$n$-gon}.

Here is a formal definition, $X\in\mathcal{P}$ if $X$ lie on the closed broken line $A_1A_2\dots A_n$ or one (and therefore any) half-line $[XY)$ which does not pass through any of $A_i$, intersects the broken line $A_1A_2\dots A_n$ at odd number of points.

In this case
\begin{itemize}
\item the points $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$ are called \index{vertex of polygon}\emph{vertices} of $\mathcal{P}$;
\item the segments $[A_1A_2]$, $[A_2A_3]$, ..., $[A_{n}A_1]$ 
are called 
\emph{side of polygon}\emph{sides} of $\mathcal{P}$;
\item the remaining segments of the form $[A_iA_j]$ are called  
\index{diagonal of polygon}\emph{diagonals} of $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{itemize}

The  $n$-gon $\mathcal{P}$ can be always divided by diagonals into $(n-2)$ triangles $\triangle A_iA_jA_k$.
This fact is not completely obvious, but it is not hard to prove.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that all the angles $\ang A_iA_jA_k$,
$\ang A_jA_kA_i$ and $\ang A_kA_iA_j$ in these triangles are positive.

Denote by $\alpha_i$ the sum of angles of all these triangles at vertex $A_i$.
Note that $\alpha_i$ takes value in $(0,2\cdot\pi)$ and it does not depend on choice of subdivision into triangles.
The angle $\alpha_i$ is called 
\index{angle!internal angle}\emph{internal angle} of $\mathcal{P}$ at $A_i$.

By Theorem~\ref{thm:sum-trig-h}, the sum of angles of each nondegenerate triangle in the subdivision is less than $\pi$.
Since the $n$-gon is divided into $n-2$ triangles, 
it follows that if $\mathcal{P}$ is a polygon in h-plane then
$$\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\dots+\alpha_n< (n-2)\cdot\pi.$$
In Eulcidean plane, according to Theorem~\ref{thm:3sum}, we have 
$$\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\dots+\alpha_n=(n-2)\cdot\pi.$$
Therefore the value
$$S(\mathcal{P})=\pi\cdot(n-2)-\alpha_1-\alpha_2-\dots-\alpha_n$$
is positive for any $n$-gon in the hyperbolic plane and zreo for any $n$-gon $\mathcal{P}$ in Euclidean plane .

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:n-sum-angle}
The functional $S$ defined above satisfies additivity; 
i.e. if a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ is cut by a broken line into two polygons 
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_2$ then
$$S(\mathcal{P})=
S(\mathcal{Q}_1)+S(\mathcal{Q}_2).$$

\end{thm}

\lbl[]{35,33;$\mathcal{Q}_2$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $\mathcal{P}$ be an $n$-gon
and the cutting the broken line has $m$ vertices inside $\mathcal{P}$.
Assume polygon $\mathcal{Q}_1$ has $n_1$ vertex shared with of $\mathcal{P}$ 
and $\mathcal{Q}_2$ has $n_2$ vertex shared with of $\mathcal{P}$.

Thus $\mathcal{Q}_1$ is an $(n_1+m)$-gon and $\mathcal{Q}_2$ is an $(n_2+m)$-gon
and 
$$n_1+n_2=n+2.\eqlbl{n1+n2}$$

Denote by $\phi$ the sum of internal angles of $\mathcal{P}$ 
and by $\psi_i$  the sum of internal angles of $\mathcal{Q}_i$.
Note that each internal angle of $\mathcal{Q}_i$ either contributes to $\phi$ or it is an angle of the broken line.
Further, each of vertex of the broken line inside of $\mathcal{P}$ contributes $2\cdot\pi$ to $\psi_1+\psi_2$.
Hence 
$$\phi+2\cdot m\cdot\pi=\psi_1+\psi_2.\eqlbl{phi1+phi2}$$
Further,
$$\begin{aligned}
S(\mathcal{P})&=(n-2)\cdot\pi-\phi
&
S(\mathcal{Q}_i)&=(n_i+m-2)\cdot\pi-\psi_i.
\end{aligned}\eqlbl{S(P)}$$
The identities \ref{n1+n2}, \ref{phi1+phi2} and \ref{S(P)} imply the result.

\section*{Area}\label{def:area}
\addtocontents{toc}{Area.}

Area is a function of the set of all polygons in the plane (Euclidean or hyperbolic).
Which satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{area:0} $\area\mathcal P>0$ for any polygon $\mathcal P$.
\item\label{area:1} If $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal P'$ are congruent polygons then
$$\area\mathcal P=\area\mathcal P'.$$
\item\label{area:2}  Additivity:
 if a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ is cut by a broken line into two polygons 
$\mathcal{Q}_1$ and $\mathcal{Q}_2$ then
$$\area\mathcal{P}=
\area\mathcal{Q}_1+\area\mathcal{Q}_2.$$
\item\label{area:3}  Normalzation\footnote{In Euclidean geometry this condition is equivalent to the fact that the unit square has area $1$. In hyperbolic plane there are no squares, so we can not normalize the area this way.}: if $a(\epsilon)$ is the area of right triangle with legs equal $\epsilon$ then
$$\lim_{\epsilon\to0} \tfrac{a(\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}=\tfrac12.$$
\end{enumerate}

In Euclidean geometry, existence of area has a  long and tedious proof.
By that reason generic textbooks 
take the existence of area as an ``obvious fact''.
That is also the reason why we did not mention area up to now in this course.

Once the existence of area is proved, 
one can derive formulas for area of triangles and use it to show uniqueness of area functional.
One could also extend the definition of area to a bigger class of sets,
in particular one can talk about area of set bounded by a circle.

In hyperbolic geometry,
proving the existence of area functional is easy;
one can take 
$$\area\mathcal{P}= S(\mathcal{P})$$
where $S(\mathcal{P})$ is defined in the previous section.

Let us check that the conditions (\ref{area:0})--(\ref{area:3}).
The condition (\ref{area:0}) is proved in the previous section.
The condition (\ref{area:1}) is obvious.
The condition (\ref{area:2}) follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:n-sum-angle}.
The condition (\ref{area:3}) can be checked by direct calculations.
\qeds


The area functional is unique (we do not prove it but it is true).
Therefore further we can always assume that
$$\area\mathcal{P}= S(\mathcal{P})$$
for any polygon $\mathcal{P}$ in h-plane.


\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:area-h-trig}
Let $\Delta$ be a triangle in h-plane with absolute values of the internal angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
Then 
$$\area\Delta=\pi-\alpha-\beta-\gamma.$$

In particular, by Theorem~\ref{thm:3sum-h},
area of any triangle in h-plane is less than $\pi$ and it is equal to $\pi$ for the ideal triangle.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:area-sup}
Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral in h-plane such that the h-angles at $A$, $B$ and $C$ are right and $AB_h=BC_h$.
 Find the optimal upper for $\area(ABCD)$
\end{thm}

















\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:area-sup}.}
Note that 
\begin{align*}
\area ABCD
&=
2\cdot\pi-|\measuredangle ABC|-|\measuredangle BCD|-|\measuredangle CDA|-|\measuredangle DAB|=
\\
&=\tfrac{\pi}2-|\measuredangle CDA|.
\end{align*}
The value $|\measuredangle CDA|$ can be arbitrary close to $0$.
Therefore $\tfrac{\pi}2$ is the optimal upper bound.









;
it is
Consider the two lines $m$ and $n$ passing through $P$ and tangent to the circle containing $\ell$.
Note that the intersections of $m$ and $n$ with the h-plane are h-lines, which do not intersect $\ell$.
Hence Axiom~h-$\!$\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:4} follows.










\parit{Proof.} 
Follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:centers-of-perp-circles}.
Note that given a point $Z$ outside of $\Omega$,
there is unique circle $\Gamma$ centered at $Z$ and perpendicular to $\Omega$.

Indeed, it is sufficient to show that the radius of $\Gamma$ is uniquely determined by $Z$ and $\Omega$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent}, 
if $T$ is a point of intersection of the circles 
$\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ then $\ang OTZ$ is right.
Clearly $ZT$ is the radius of $\Gamma$.
By Pythagorean theorem, 
\begin{align*}
ZT^2&=ZO^2-OT^2=
\\
&=ZO^2-r^2,
\end{align*}
where $r$ is the radius of $\Omega$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{43mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-5mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/PO-Gamma(1)}
\lbl[br]{6,31.5;$\Omega$}

\lbl[t]{33,16;$P$}
\lbl[t]{40,16;$Z$}
\lbl[b]{33,30;$T$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

If in addition $O$ is the inversion of $P$ in $\Gamma$ then 
$Z\in (OP)$ and $OZ\cdot PZ=ZT^2$.
In particular, $\triangle OTZ\sim \triangle TPZ$.

Since $\ang OTZ$ is right, 
so are $\ang ZPT$ and $\ang OPT$.
It follows that $\triangle OPT\sim OTZ$ 
since $\ang POT$ is shared.
In particular,
$$OP\cdot OZ=OT^2;$$
i.e., $Z$ is the inversion of $P$ in $\Omega$

Summarizing, we get that a circle $\Gamma$ satisfies the condition of the lemma
if and only if $\Gamma\perp\Omega$
and
its center  $Z$ is the inversion of $P$ in $\Omega$.
Hence the result follows.
\qeds













\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:hat-d-and-+}.} 
Notice that for a fixed $\alpha$,
 the map $\beta\mapsto f(\alpha,\beta)$ is a motion of $((-\pi,\pi],\hat d)$.
The same way, for fixed $\beta$ the map $\alpha\mapsto f(\alpha,\beta)$ is a motion of $((-\pi,\pi],\hat d)$.

Applying triangle inequality, we get
\begin{align*}
\hat d(f(\alpha_n,\beta_n),f(\alpha,\beta))
&\le\hat d(f(\alpha_n,\beta_n),f(\alpha_n,\beta)
+
\hat d(f(\alpha_n,\beta),f(\alpha,\beta)
=
\\
&=
\hat d(\beta_n,\beta)+\hat d(\alpha_n,\alpha).
\end{align*}
In particular, $\alpha_n\to\alpha$ and $\beta_n\to \beta$
implies that $f(\alpha_n,\beta_n)\to f(\alpha,\beta)$
in $((-\pi,\pi],\hat d)$ as $n\to\infty$.














\section*{Congruent sets}
\addtocontents{toc}{Congruent sets.}



(In a more abstract language this means that  the set of motions $\mathcal X\to\mathcal X$ forms a {}\emph{group}.
This group is called \index{group of motions}\emph{group of motions} of $\mathcal X$.
The identity map $\mathcal X\to\mathcal X$ serves as the unit element  and composition is the group operation.)

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Two subsets $V,W\subset \mathcal X$ are called \index{congruent subsets}\emph{congruent} (briefly \index{$\cong$}$V\z\cong W$)
if there is a motion $f\:\mathcal X\to\mathcal X$ which sends $V$ to $W$.
\end{thm}

It is evident from the above that ``$\cong$'' is an  \index{equivalence relation}\emph{equivalence relation};
i.e., 
\begin{itemize}
\item $V\cong W$ if and only if $W\cong V$ and 
\item if $U\cong V$ and $V\cong W$ then $U\cong W$.
\end{itemize}


Note that congruent sets have to be isometric to each other.
The following example shows that on the Manhattan plane $(\mathbb{R}^2,d_1)$ isometric subsets might be not congruent.

On the other hand,
any pair isometric sets of Euclidean plane $(\mathbb{R}^2,d_2)$ are congruent.
We will not use, but it might be useful to know.



therefore all the sets $\{A,B\}$, $\{A,C\}$ and $\{B,C\}$ are isometric to each other.
Note that the map $f\:(x,y)\mapsto (-x,y)$ is a motion of $(\mathbb{R}^2,d_1)$; 
$f(A)=A$ and $f(B)=C$.
Thus the set $\{A,B\}$ is congruent to the set $\{A,C\}$.









\section*{Metric on $\bm{(-\pi,\pi]}$}
\addtocontents{toc}{Metric on $(-\pi,\pi]$.}

Note that for any real number $\alpha$ there is unique value $\beta\in(-\pi,\pi]$ such that
$\beta\equiv \alpha$.
By that reason we may assume that angle measure takes value in the real interval $(-\pi,\pi]$

We need to introduce a metric $\hat{d}$ on $(-\pi,\pi]$
different from the metric induced from $\mathbb{R}$.
Further we will use this metric in the formulation 
of continuity of angle measure.
Note that angles with measures $\pm(\pi-\epsilon)$ are ``geometrically close'' for small $\epsilon>0$;
so, in this metric $\hat{d}$, the values $\pm(\pi-\epsilon)$ have to be close to each other.

Given two real numbers 
$\alpha,\beta\in (-\pi,\pi]$,
set \label{def:max-dist}\index{$\hat{d}$}
$$\hat{d}(\alpha,\beta)
=
\min\{|\alpha-\beta|,2\cdot\pi-|\alpha-\beta|\}.
\eqlbl{eq:def-hat-d}
$$

Next we will show that $\hat{d}$ is a metric.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
The function $\hat{d}(\alpha,\beta)$ is a metric on the set $(-\pi,\pi]$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Among the conditions in the Definition~\ref{def:metric-space}, we need to prove only triangle inequality
$$\hat{d}(\alpha,\gamma)\le \hat{d}(\alpha,\beta)+\hat{d}(\beta,\gamma);
\eqlbl{eq:trig-inq-hat-d}$$
the rest of conditions are  evident.

Note that if $\alpha-\beta\equiv \alpha'-\beta'$
for some values 
$\alpha,\beta,\alpha',\beta'\in (-\pi,\pi]$
then 
$$\hat{d}(\alpha,\beta)
=
\hat{d}(\alpha',\beta').
\eqlbl{eq:hat-d+shift}$$
Indeed, without loss of generality we may assume that $\delta=\alpha-\beta>0$;
since $\alpha-\beta\equiv \alpha'-\beta'$,
we have $\alpha'-\beta'$ may only take  values $\delta$, or $\delta-2\cdot\pi $.
In both cases \ref{eq:hat-d+shift} follows from \ref{eq:def-hat-d}.

Therefore we can assume in \ref{eq:trig-inq-hat-d}
that $\beta=0$;
i.e., we need to prove that
$$\hat{d}(\alpha,\gamma)
\le 
\hat{d}(\alpha,0)+\hat{d}(0,\gamma);
$$
Or equivalently,
$$\min\{|\alpha+\gamma|,2\cdot\pi-|\alpha+\gamma|\}\le |\alpha|+|\gamma|.$$
The later is true since 
$|\alpha+\gamma|\le |\alpha|+|\gamma|$.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:hat-d-and-+}
Consider the map 
$f(\alpha,\beta)$ which returns a number in $(-\pi,\pi]$ for any pair of numbers $\alpha,\beta\in (-\pi,\pi]$
such that 
$$f(\alpha,\beta)\equiv \alpha+\beta.$$
(By now, it should be evident that $f$ is uniquely defined.)

Show that $f$ is continuous with respect to the metric $\hat d$.
\end{thm}











\parit{Proof.}
Recall that $\hat d$ denotes the metric on the interval $(-\pi,\pi]$
introduced on page \pageref{def:max-dist}.
Consider function $s\:(-\pi,\pi]\to \mathbb{R}$
defined as 
$$s(\alpha)=\left[
\begin{aligned}
&\pi-\alpha&&\text{if}&&\alpha\ge\tfrac\pi2
\\
&\alpha&&\text{if}&&-\tfrac\pi2\le\alpha\le\tfrac\pi2
\\
-\,&\pi-\alpha&&\text{if}&&\alpha\le-\tfrac\pi2
\end{aligned}
\right.
.$$
Note that for any $\alpha\in (-\pi,\pi]$ we have
$s(\alpha)=\tfrac\pi2-\hat d(\alpha,\tfrac\pi2)$.
Therefore by triangle inequality
$|s(\alpha)-s(\beta)|\le d(\alpha,\beta)$. 
In particular 
$$s\:((-\pi,\pi],\hat{d})\to\mathbb{R}$$ 
is a continuous function.
Further note that
\begin{itemize}
\item $s(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha=0$ or $\pi$;
\item $s(\alpha)>0$ if and only if $0<\alpha<\pi$;
\item $s(\alpha)<0$ if and only if $\alpha<0$.
\end{itemize}
In particular, if $\measuredangle AOB\ne 0,\pi$ 
then the angle $\ang AOB$ and the real number $s(\measuredangle AOB)$ have the same sign.

Consider the function 
$f(t)=\measuredangle A_tO_tB_t$.

Since 
the points $O_t$, $A_t$ and $B_t$ do not lie on one line,
Theorem~\ref{thm:straight-angle} implies that $f(t)=\measuredangle A_tO_tB_t\ne 0$ or $\pi$ for any $t\in[0,1]$.
Therefore by Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2c},
$f$ is a continuous function.
Further,
by Intermediate value theorem, $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ have the same sign;
hence the result follows.
\qeds








\item\label{def:birkhoff-axioms:2c} 
The function $\measuredangle\:(A,O,B)\mapsto\measuredangle A O B$
is defined at the set $W$ of all triples 
$(A,O,B)$ such that $O\ne A$ and $O\ne B$.
Moreover if $\hat{d}$ denotes the metric on $(-\pi,\pi]$ introduced above then
$$\measuredangle\: W\to ((-\pi,\pi],\hat{d})$$ 
is continuous.









\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:angle-signs-in-trig}

&
\measuredangle A'B'C'&\equiv\pm\measuredangle ABC,
\\
&\text{and}&\measuredangle B'C'A'&\equiv\pm\measuredangle BCA,
\end{align*}
Show that the signs in the above three identities can be chosen
to be the same. 
\end{thm}









\parit{Proof.}
Assume first that $C_1=C_2$, so we can set 
\begin{align*}
C&=C_1=C_2,
&
C'&=C_1'=C_2.
\end{align*}


Applying to Proposition~\ref{prop:arc(angle=tan)},
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle X_1AX_2&\equiv\measuredangle X_1AC+\measuredangle CAX_2\equiv
\\
&\equiv(\pi-\measuredangle CB_1A)+(\pi-\measuredangle AB_2 C)\equiv
\\
&
\equiv -(\measuredangle CB_1A+\measuredangle AB_2 C)
\end{align*}

Analogously,
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle Y_1A'Y_2&
\equiv -(\measuredangle C'B_1'A'+\measuredangle A'B_2' C').
\end{align*}

By Theorem~\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle}(\ref{lem:inverse-4-angle:angle}), 
\[\measuredangle CB_1A+\measuredangle AB_2 C
\equiv
-(\measuredangle C'B_1'A'+\measuredangle A'B_2' C')
\]
Hence the result follows.

Now let us come back to the general case.

Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be the circlines containing the arcs $AB_1C_1$ and $AB_2C_2$.
Assume $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ intersect at two points at $A$ and say at $C$.
In this case we can extend or shorten the arcs  $AB_iC_i$ in $\Gamma_i$ to make the $C_1=C_2=C$;
note that it will not change the angles between tangent half-lines at $A$.
This way we reduce the problem to the case which was already considered.

The remaining case when $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are tangent at $A$ is left to the reader;
it can be proved applying the case above twice.

Moreover, if $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D\equiv 0$
then the points $A$ and $D$ lie on the opposite sides from $(BC)$ 
and if $\measuredangle A B C+\measuredangle B C D\equiv \pi$
 the points $A$ and $D$ lie on the same side from $(BC)$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We may assume that $\measuredangle ABC\ne 0$ or $\pi$;
otherwise the statement is evident. 

\parit{}($\Leftarrow$).
Arguing by contradiction, 
assume \ref{A B C + B C D} holds, but $(AB)\z\nparallel(C D)$.
Let $Z$ be the point of intersection of $(AB)$ and $(CD)$.

Denote by $M$ be the midpoint of $[BC]$; note that $M\ne Z$.
Choose $Z'\in (ZM)$ distinct from $Z$ such that $MZ'=MZ$.

Note that two pairs of angles 
$\ang ZMB$, $\ang Z'MC$
and
$\ang ZMC$, $\ang Z'MB$
are vertical.
It follows that
\begin{align*}
\triangle MZB&\cong \triangle MZ'C,
& 
\triangle MZC&\cong \triangle MZ'B,
\\
\measuredangle MBZ&=\measuredangle MCZ',
&
\measuredangle MCZ&=\measuredangle MBZ'.
\end{align*}

Since $Z$ lies on $(AB)$ and $(CD)$,
we have
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\measuredangle ABC&\equiv 2\cdot\measuredangle ZBC
&
2\cdot\measuredangle BCD &\equiv 2\cdot\measuredangle BCZ
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\measuredangle ZBZ'
&\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle ZBC+2\cdot \measuredangle CBZ'\equiv
\\
&\equiv 2\cdot \measuredangle ZBC+2\cdot \measuredangle BCZ\equiv
\\
&\equiv 0
\end{align*}
That is, $Z'\in (AB)$.

The same way we get that $Z'\in (CD)$.
By Axiom~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2}, $(CD)=(AB)$,
in particular $(CD)=(AB)$.

\parit{}($\Rightarrow$). Assume $(AB)\parallel(C D)$.
Choose $D'$ so that 
$$2\cdot \measuredangle A B C+2\cdot \measuredangle B C D'\equiv 0.$$
Then according to ``if''-part, $(AB)\parallel (CD')$.

From the uniqueness of parallel line (Theorem~\ref{thm:parallel})
we get $(CD)=(CD')$.
In particular, $2\cdot\measuredangle BCD\equiv 2\cdot\measuredangle BCD'$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $A$ and $B$ the ideal points of $\ell$.

Applying an isometry of h-plane if necessary,
we may assume $Q$ is the center of absolute, 
so $[AB]$ is a diameter of absolute.

Draw the h-line $(PZ)_h$
so
the circle $\Gamma$ containing $(PZ)_h$ is tangent to $(AB)$ at $A$.
Clearly $|\measuredangle_h Q P Z|=\phi$; without loss of generality 
we may assume that $\measuredangle_h Q P Z=\phi$.

Set $a=QP$; by Lemma~\ref{lem:O-h-dist},
$$a=\frac{e^h-1}{e^h+1}.$$

Let $P'$ be the inverse of $P$ in the absolute
and $M$ be the midpoint of $[PP']$.
Clearly 
$$PM=\tfrac12\cdot(QP'-QP)=\frac{\frac1a-a}{2}.$$

Note that $\phi=\measuredangle MHP$.
Since $HM=AQ=1$, we get
$$\tan\phi=\frac{MP}{HM}=\frac{\frac1a-a}{2}$$


Therefore
$$\tan \phi
=\frac{\frac{e^h+1}{e^h-1}-\frac{e^h-1}{e^h+1}}2
=\frac{4\cdot e^{h}}{2\cdot( e^{2\cdot h}-1)}
=\frac{2}{e^{h}-e^{-h}}=\frac1{\sinh h}.$$

Further we assume that both arcs are nondegenerate.
The degenerate cases are left to the reader.

According to Theorem~\ref{thm:tangent-angle},

&\equiv -2\cdot \measuredangle Y_1CA,
\\
2\cdot \measuredangle CAX_2
&\equiv -2\cdot \measuredangle ACY_2.
\end{align*}
Since the pairs of points $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$
lie on the same side from $(AC)$,
we get that the  angles in the pairs of angles 
$\ang X_1AC$, $\ang Y_1CA$ 
and $\ang CAX_2$, $\ang ACY_2$
have opposite signs.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle X_1AC

 \measuredangle CAX_2
&\equiv - \measuredangle ACY_2.

Adding these two identities, we get the result.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:tangent-to-tangent}
Let $AB_1C_1$ and $AB_2C_2$ be arcs tangent at $A$.
Assume $A'B_1'C_1'$ and $A'B_2'C_2'$ be their inversions in a circle.
Then the arcs $A'B_1'C_1'$ and $A'B_2'C_2'$ are tangent at $A'$.
\end{thm}

This lemma might look evident, 
but the formal proof is not short and tedious.

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_1'$ and $\Gamma_2'$ the circles containing arcs $AB_1C_1$, $AB_2C_2$, $A'B_1'C_1'$ and $A'B_2'C_2'$ correspondingly.

Note that $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are tangent at $A$; i.e., $A$ is the only point of intersection of 
$\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$.
Therefore $\Gamma_1'$ and $\Gamma_2'$ are tangent at $A'$.
In particular the tangent lines to $\Gamma_1'$ and $\Gamma_2'$ at $A'$ coincide.

It remains to show that the half lines tangent to $A'B_1'C_1'$ and $A'B_2'C_2'$ at $A'$ can not be opposite. 

Let $[AX)$ be the tangent half-line to arcs $AB_1C_1$ and $AB_2C_2$  at $A$ 
and $[AY_1)$ be the tangent half-lines to arcs $A'B_1'C_1'$   at $A'$.
Denote by $O$ the center of inversion.

Note that
 the angles $\ang OAX$ and $\ang OAY_1$ have the same signs.
Further $\ang OAX$ is acute (obtuse)
if and only if $\ang OAY_1$  is obtuse (correspondingly acute).

Repeating the same argument for half-line $[AY_2)$ which is tangent  to the arcs $A'B_2'C_2'$   at $A'$,
we get that angles $\ang OAY_1$ and $\ang OAY_2$ have the same sign which implies that they can not be opposite unless the angles are $0$ and $\pi$.
In the remaining case these angle have to be both  acute or  both obtuse;
which means they both $0$ or both $\pi$.

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $A\ne A'$; i.e., $A$ does not lie on the circle of inversion.

According to Exercise~\ref{ex:tangent-arc},
there are arcs $AZ_1A'$ and $AZ_2A'$ such that the half-lines $[AX_1)$ and $[AX_2)$
are tangent to these arcs at $A$.

From Corollary~\ref{cor:perp-inverse}, it follows that
the arcs $AZ_1A'$ and $AZ_2A'$ are inverted to themselves.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:tangent-to-tangent}, 
arc $AZ_1A'$ is tangent to arc $A'B_1'C_1'$
and  $AZ_2A'$ is tangent to arc $A'B_2'C_2'$ at $A'$.

From Exercise~\ref{ex:two-arcs}, the result follows.

The remaining special case $A\in\Omega$ is left to the reader;
see Exercise~\ref{ex:3-inverions} for a hint.

\parit{Proof.} Denote by $Q$ the intersection of $[OP)$ and $[AB]$.
We need to show that $Q=\hat P$.

Let $P'$ be inverse of $P$ in $\Omega$.
According to ???, $P'\in \Gamma$.
Set $x=OP$, so $OP'=\tfrac1x$.

By ??? $$\triangle QPA\sim\triangle QBP'\ \ \text{and}\ \ \triangle QPB\sim\triangle QAP'.$$
Further by ???
$$\triangle OPA\sim\triangle OAP'\ \ \text{and}\ \ \triangle OPB\sim\triangle OBP'.$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\frac{P'Q}{PQ}&=\frac{AQ}{PQ}\cdot\frac{P'Q}{AQ}=
\\
&=\frac{P'A}{BP}\cdot\frac{P'B}{PA}=
\\
&=\frac{P'B}{BP}\cdot\frac{P'A}{PA}=
\\
&=\frac{OP'}{OB}\cdot\frac{OP'}{OA}=\frac1{x^2}.
\end{align*}
It follows that
$$PQ=$$


Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P$ lies inside $\Omega$;
otherwise sqitch $P$ with $P'$.
Set $a=OP$, so

Then 
\begin{align*}
OQ&=OP+PQ=
\\
&=OP+PP'\cdot \frac{PQ}{P'Q}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $P$ and $Q$ be distinct points in h-plane and the points $A$ and $B$ are the ideal points of h-line $(PQ)_h$.
Then the points $A$, $\hat P$, $\hat Q$ and $B$ lie on one line.
More over 
$$PQ_h=\tfrac12\cdot\ln\frac{A\hat P\cdot B\hat Q}{\hat PB\cdot \hat QA}.$$
\end{thm}

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In hyperbolic geometry the definition of parallel lines is slightly different.
Given a point $P$ off the h-line $(AB)_h$ 
there are infinite number of h-lines passing through $P$ and not intersecting $(AB)_h$. 
Among them there are only two parallel h-lines to $(AB)_h$. 
An h-line $(PQ)_h$ is called parallel to $(AB)_h$
in direction from $A$ to $B$ if the points $Q$ and $B$ lie on one side from $(AP)_h$, but any line from $P$ which leaves $Q$ and $A$ on the opposite sides is intersecting $(AB)_h$.

If $Q$ as above and $F$ is the foot point of $P$ on $(AB)_h$ then $\phi=|\measuredangle_h FPQ|$ is called angle of parallelism.
Clearly $\phi$ is completely determined by $h=PF_h$.

The same way one can define an h-line parallel to $(AB)_h$
in direction from $B$ to $A$.
The remaining lines through $P$ which do not intesect $(AB)_h$ are called ultra parallel.












\section{}

Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points of h-plane.
Define h-distance  as 
$$PQ_h=-\ln\delta(P,Q).$$
\parbf{Comments.}
Since $\delta(P,Q)\le 1$, we need to use negative constant in front of $\ln\delta(P,Q)$ to make $PQ_h$ nonnegative.
We might use any negative constant instead of $-1$, all of them will give a metric; the choice of the constant is made to have some formulas simpler.


\begin{thm}{Theorem} \label{lem:h-dist}
The function $(P,Q)\mapsto PQ_h$ is a distance function on h-plane.
Moreover, if we equip h-plane with h-distance function then
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Any inverse in extended line is an isometry of h-plane.
\item  h-lines and only they form a lines in h-plane.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}



\parit{Proof.}
From Lemma~\ref{lem:0-1}, $PQ_h\ge0$ and $PQ_h=0$ iff $P=Q$.

From Lemma~\ref{lem:delta-inverse}, it follows that inverse in extended line 
preserves h-distance. 
Further, from Lemma~\ref{lem:perp-inverse}, any such inverse is a bijection of h-plane. 

It remains to prove triangle inequality;
i.e.
$$PQ_h\le PZ_h+ZQ_h\eqlbl{eq:h-tringle}$$
for any $Z$ in h-plane.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{35mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/h-triangle-in(0.8)}
\lbl[t]{8,26;$P$}
\lbl[t]{29,38;${\leftarrow} Q$}
\lbl[t]{21,30;$Z$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

From Lemma~\ref{lem:delta-dot}, it follows that \ref{eq:h-tringle} becomes equality for any $Z\in[PQ]_h$.
Thus, if \ref{eq:h-tringle} does not hold, then for some $Z\in[PQ]_h$ there is $Z'$ in the h-plane such that $PZ'_h<PZ_h$ and $QZ'_h<QZ_h$.

Apply Lemma~\ref{lem:delta-inverse}, for $P$ and $\lambda=\delta(P,Z)$ and for $Q$ and $\lambda=\delta(Q,Z)$.
We get two circles $\Gamma_P$ and $\Gamma_Q$,
both of them are passing through $Z$ and perpendicular to $(PQ)_h$.
It follows that circles $\Gamma_P$ and $\Gamma_Q$ are tangent at $Z$
and there is no point $Z'$ which lie inside $\Gamma_P$ and $\Gamma_Q$ at the same time.
Moreover $Z$ is the only point of intersection of $\Gamma_P$ and $\Gamma_Q$.

Finally note that since \ref{eq:h-tringle} becomes equality for any $Z\in[PQ]_h$, 
any h-line forms a line in h-plane with h-distance;
i.e. any h-line equipped with h-distance is isometric to $\mathbb{R}$. 
Since $Z$ is the only point of intersection of $\Gamma_P$ and $\Gamma_Q$, it follows that there no other lines in this metric space.

\section*{Axiom~IV}

Further we always assume that h-plane is equipped with h-distance function.

Above we proved (Theorem~\ref{lem:h-dist}) that h-plane is a metric space, obliviously it contains at least two points.
Further, theorems~\ref{lem:h-dist} and \ref{thm:h-line} show that that Axiom~I holds for h-plane.
The fact that Axiom~II holds for h-plane follows directly from the definition of h-angle.

To show that model Poincar\'e satisfies Definition~\ref{def:birkhoff-axioms-absolute},
it remains to prove that Axiom~IV holds in h-plane.
That is, we need to prove the following theorem:

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Assume that for h-triangles $\triangle_h A B C$ and $\triangle_h A' B' C'$ in the h-plane, we have
$$A' B'_h= A B_h,
\ A' C'_h= A C_h$$
$$\ \text{and}\ 
\measuredangle_h C' A' B'=\pm\measuredangle_h C A B.\eqlbl{birkhoff-signs}$$
Then 
$$ B' C'_h= B C_h,
\ \measuredangle_h A' B' C'=\pm\measuredangle_h A B C,
\ \measuredangle_h B' C' A'=\pm\measuredangle_h B  C A $$
With signs as in \ref{birkhoff-signs}.

In particular $\triangle_h A B C\cong\triangle_h A' B' C'$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Note that there is an h-line $\ell$ such that the inverse in the extension of $\ell$ sends $A$ to the center of absolute.
Recall that inverse in $\ell$ preserves h-distance only changes the sign of h-angles.%???
Thus, we may assume that $A$ is the center of absolute.
The same way we may assume that $A'$ is also the center of absolute (so $A'=A$).

It follows that the sides $[AB]_h$, $[AC]_h$, $[AB']_h$ and $[AC']_h$ are also segments in ordinary Euclidean sense.
In particular 
$$\measuredangle B'AC'\equiv\measuredangle_h B'AC'\equiv\pm\measuredangle_h BAC\equiv\pm\measuredangle BAC.$$
Direct calculation show that 
$$AB_h=-\ln\frac{r-AB}{r+AB},$$
where $r$ is the radius of absolute.
Therefore $A B'=AB$ and $A C'=AC$.
It follows that there is a rotation or reflection of euclidean plane which does not move $A$ and sends $B\mapsto B'$, $C\mapsto C'$.
Note that the rotation or reflection described above is also an isometry of h-plane,
moreover it preserves h-angles.
Hence   
$$ B' C'_h= B C_h,
\ \measuredangle_h A' B' C'=\pm\measuredangle_h A B C,
\ \measuredangle_h B' C' A'=\pm\measuredangle_h B  C A.$$

\section*{Larger angle---longer side}

The next corollary states that in a nondegenerate triangle 
the larger side corresponds to a larger angle.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:larger-side=>larger-angle}
Assume that in a triangle $\triangle ABC$ the angles $\ang CAB$ and $\ang ABC$ are positive.
Then then 
$CA>CB$ if and only if $\measuredangle CAB>\measuredangle ABC$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Note that for degenerate triangle the statement is trivially holds.

Set $\alpha=\measuredangle CAB$ and $\beta=\measuredangle ABC$.
If $\alpha=\beta$ then by Theorem~\ref{thm:isos},
$CA=CB$.

Therefore,  $\pi>\alpha> \beta>0$ or $\pi> \beta>\alpha>0$.
We will consider the first case; 
the second is completely analogous.

\lbl[l]{22,24;$Z$}
\lbl[r]{31,5;$\beta$}
\lbl[lw]{13,10;$\alpha$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Use Axiom \ref{def:birkhoff-axioms:2a}
to construct the half-line $[AX)$ 
such that $\measuredangle XAB=\beta$.

Note that the angle
$\measuredangle XAC= \beta-\alpha$ is negative.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:half-plane}, 
$C$ and $B$ lie on the opposite sides of $(AX)$.
Hence $[CB]$ intersects $(AX)$ at a point, say at $Z$.

Note that $\measuredangle ZAB$ is either $\beta$ or $\beta-\pi$.
On the other hand $Z$ and $C$ lie on the same side from $(AB)$ and therefore the $\measuredangle ZAB>0$.
Hence 
$$\measuredangle ZAB=\beta.$$

By ASA consition (\ref{thm:ASA}), 
$$ZA=ZB.$$
By Corollary \ref{cor:degenerate-trig},
$$AC>AZ+CZ$$.
Therefore
$$AC>AZ+CZ=BZ+ZC=BZ.$$
